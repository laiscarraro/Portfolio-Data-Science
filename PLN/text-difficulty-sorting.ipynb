Without the brain, you would not be able to think, feel, move, remember, or do all the things that make you the special person you are.\n","\n","At birth, the brains of infants weigh the same. But by adulthood, that changes. The average male brain weighs about 11 to 12 percent more than a woman's brain. But brain weight and size have nothing to do with intelligence. What matters is what's inside the brain.\n","\n","Despite its small size (about 3 pounds), the brain is able to receive and send an unlimited number of messages. It does this with the help of the spinal cord, the sense organs, and the autonomic (automatic) nervous system. The brain carries out this task by assigning jobs.\n","\n","It puts the cerebellum (sair-ah-BELL-um) in charge of balance and coordination.\n","The brainstem regulates heartbeat, breathing, and blood pressure.\n","And the largest parts of the brain, the cerebral cortex (suh-REE-brul CORE-tex) and the cerebrum (suh-REE-brum), control thoughts, feelings, and actions.\n","The cerebrum is divided into two halves. Each controls the muscles on the opposite side of the body. So if you usually eat with your right hand and kick with your right foot, then your brain's left half is said to \"dominate,\" and you're right-handed. When the opposite is true, your brain's right half takes the lead and you're left-handed.\n","\n","People use both halves of the brain, but the left half is especially good at helping you with words and numbers and helping you read and speak. The right side is better at creative tasks, such as music and art. And your sense of humor develops there.\n","\n","Each half has four sets of lobes (sections). The frontal lobes behind your forehead do a lot of the thinking and planning. The parietal (pa-RYE-ih-tul) lobes toward the back of your head sense pain.

Still, the area the climbers were in was thought to be safe.\n","\n","The rebel soldiers took the climbers prisoner. The rebels hoped that they could trade the climbers for food or weapons.\n","\n","Prisoners!\n","For days, the climbers and the rebels hiked through the mountains. Government helicopters flew overhead. The rebels hid the prisoners under sticks and dirt so that they couldn't be seen from the air.\n","\n","The climbers each ate half an energy bar per day. They drank muddy water.

The leader said he and others would return to the climbers' camp to get fresh ones. He left one man to keep the prisoners on the move.\n","\n","The group crept along a cliff over a 1,500-foot drop. \"[The guard] was having a hard time getting around,\" Smith said. \"He stopped, and someone yelled, 'Now!' Then we pushed him off.\"\n","\n","The guard's arms and legs thrashed in panic as he fell toward a river below. \"I don't think anyone could survive a fall like that,\" Smith said. \"No. Nobody could.\"\n","\n","The climbers ran for the government's army camp. They ran for 18 miles. As they neared the camp, rebels began shooting at them. Government soldiers shot back. \"We're Americans!\" Smith yelled. \"We're Americans!\"\n","\n","Moments later, the climbers were safe in the camp. Soldiers lent them clean clothes.

Some experts say that winter blues happen because we get less sunlight in the winter than we do in other seasons. Some say that the decrease in sunlight can make us feel sad. Getting extra sunlight each day can help brighten your mood.\n","Get some exercise. A brisk walk or other exercise will make chemicals called endorphins flow through your body. Endorphins are natural \"feel good\" chemicals.\n","Eat more healthful foods. Avoid having too much sugar. If you crave sugary foods (like cookies or candy), it may be a sign that you need more protein (like meat, chicken, or fish).\n","Avoid holiday stress. Cut back if you have too many things to do. Make sure you have some quiet time to yourself. Get some rest. Don't be so busy that you get run-down. Studies show that most teens need about nine hours of sleep each night. The average teen, though, gets only about six or seven hours of sleep per night.\n","Get help.

Or just because your friends wanted you to? That’s peer pressure. And just about everyone feels it at one time or another.\n","\n","Peers are people your age, such as your friends, who have experiences similar to yours. Your peers influence your decisions and behavior every day, and they can push you to make bad choices, even dangerous ones. But is peer pressure always bad?\n","\n","Positive Spin on Peer Pressure\n","\n","“Peer pressure can sometimes be a good thing,” says Ian Brennan, cocreator and one of the writers of the TV show Glee. That show dealt with the issue of peer pressure all the time, through the experiences of musical kids in a not-so-popular high school chorus. “Friends can give you the courage to try something you normally wouldn’t, like a new sport or auditioning for the school play,” Brennan points out.\n","\n","Nicole S., 16, of Edmore, N.D., used to be afraid of singing in front of people. One time, her friends convinced her to sing karaoke with them. She ended up having fun! “Now I will sing anywhere, even with people present. Positive peer pressure helped me face my fear,” she says.\n","\n","Pressure’s On!\n","\n","You are surrounded by your peers all the time, and you learn a lot—both good and bad—by just being around them. You might admire a star athlete. Maybe you notice the popular kids at school and look up to them. Those aren’t necessarily bad things. The popular group could be really nice; the athlete, a hard worker. Being inspired and influenced by different peer groups could help you in the long run.\n","\n","The people around you can also be negative influences, however. Maybe a star teammate tells you never to pass the ball to a certain player, or a popular student cheats on tests or sends mean texts. Should you try to be like them to fit in?\n","\n","Peer Pressure Is a Fact of Life\n","\n","“It’s not a matter of if peer pressure is going to happen,” says Lee Erickson, coordinator for the Northern Lights Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD) group in North Dakota. “It’s a matter of when.”\n","\n","“The main thing is not to compromise who you are,” Erickson continues. “The kind of coolness and popularity you think you may get by joining the crowd and doing risky stuff is temporary. Your character is with you for the rest of your life.”\n","\n","Nicole agrees. “My motto is be who you are, not who others want you to be,” she says.\n","\n","Peer pressure is powerful, but the ability to choose is yours. If a situation feels wrong, there’s a good chance it is wrong. Think about what’s best for you—and what you’ll say or do—before you’re in a sticky situation. “No one has tried to get me to smoke or drink yet, but I know there will come a time,” says Schuyler W., 13, of Seattle. “The thing is, I know I don’t want to do it, so when it does happen, I’m just going to stick up for myself and say no.”\n","\n","Make pacts with your friends to stay away from risky situations together and to support one another when the going gets tough. Talk with your parents about ways they can “bail you out” if you need to save face with your peers. (For instance, if someone asks you to hang out after school and you think there might be drinking or drugs around, you can tell them your parents need you to come home right away.)\n","\n","Should You or Shouldn’t You?\n","\n","Standing up for yourself and saying no isn’t always easy. But you might give voice to a bunch of peers that feel the same way you do. It can take just one person to speak out and change a situation. According to Erickson, “People will respect you for standing up for yourself—even if it doesn’t seem like it right away.”\n","\n","“If friends try to get you to do something that you know in your heart feels wrong,” says Glee’s Brennan, “tell them exactly how you feel. And if they’re not cool about it, find new friends.”\n","\n","That can be hard to do, but sometimes it’s necessary. “If your so-called friends are trying to get you to do negative things, do you really think they’re the best of friends?” asks Nicole. “To me, real friends accept you for who you are [and] what you believe in, and respect your decisions.”\n","\n","Bad News and Good News\n","\n","“Negative peer pressure gets ahold of us kids really easily,” says Nicole. “Because our friends do it, we’re told something’s ‘cool’ or we’re pressured to try something ‘just one time’ because it won’t hurt.”\n","\n","Some kids decide to go with the flow regardless of what they know is right. They tell themselves that being popular or being liked is more important than their own sense of self. It doesn’t make sense, but that’s the problem with peer pressure. You can lose yourself. But you can also find yourself, as Schuyler did when he was asked to go camping last year. He really didn’t want to go.\n","\n","“Sometimes your friends get you to do stuff you don’t want to do, and it turns out great,” he says. “I didn’t want to go camping, but my friends really wanted me to go. Finally, I gave in, and I’m so glad I did. The trip was awesome! We did a lot of fun stuff I would never have done on my own.”\n","\n","The good news is peer pressure isn’t always something to fear. Your decisions are yours to make. Take the time to make them wisely.\n","\n","Power Up\n","\n","Resisting negative peer pressure is a challenge, but it is definitely possible. Here are a few tips for navigating all kinds of pressure-filled situations:\n","\n","Find real friends who accept the real you. Knowing whom to listen to and whom to avoid is the key to steering clear of negative peer pressure.\n","Know what to say. “Just say doing that stuff really isn’t your thing,” says Elli L., 15, of North Dakota. “You can also blame your parents—it works wonders.”\n","Be confident. Stick up for yourself. People will respect you for it.\n","Think about it. Keep in mind that just one destructive decision can change your whole life, says Nicole S., 16, also of North Dakota. Think: How might this one moment affect how you see yourself?\n","Getting Real With SADD\n","\n","Looking to join other kids who want to make smart decisions and avoid negative peer pressure? Check out Students Against Destructive Decisions (SADD). It’s a national group, based in middle schools and high schools, that works to save lives by spreading the word about the dangers of risky behaviors such as drinking, using tobacco, bullying, and driving distractedly (including driving while using a cell phone).\n","\n","SADD is a great resource for kids who are feeling pressured. “It is comforting to know that there are so many people supporting each other,” says Elli L., a SADD member in North Dakota. “We all kind of hold each other up.”'''.capitalize(),\n","'''Austria-Hungary felt its power slipping after the Archduke’s assassination. It wanted to assert itself and try to regain control. Austria-Hungary prepared to take action against Serbia. First, however, Austria-Hungary went to seek help and support from its neighbor Germany. Germany assured Austria-Hungary that the German government would support any Austro-Hungarian action against Serbia. On July 28, 1914, Austria-Hungary declared war on Serbia. World War I began.\n","As Germany supported Austria-Hungary, Russia supported Serbia. As soon as Austria-Hungary declared war, Russia started preparing troops for battle.\n","Germany took Russia’s preparation as an act of war against Austria-Hungary. Germany declared war on Russia.\n","France was tied to Russia by a separate treaty. France declared war on Germany to keep its promise to Russia. \n","In response to France’s declaration of war, Germany invaded a neutral country, Belgium. Belgium was close to France and Germany wanted to take over France. \n","Britain was bound by a treaty to France and Belgium. Britain declared war on Germany.\n","In 1914 Britain was still an empire. All of Britain’s territories overseas entered the war on Britain’s side. Their entrance extended the war beyond the boundaries of Europe. Australia, Canada, India, New Zealand, and the Union of South Africa joined the fighting.\n","Japan had military ties to Britain. Soon Japan declared war on Germany.  In response, Austria-Hungary declared war on Japan.\n","The United States declared that it would remain neutral. However, this policy of neutrality could not last forever.'''.capitalize(),\n","'''When plates in the earth spread apart, molten lava comes up from the planet’s inner layers. It then spits out of the mouth of the volcano. Lava is very hot. It is 10 times as hot as boiling water. If you stand too close to flowing lava, your eyelashes and eyebrows will instantly burn off.\n","\n","Lava spews out of a volcano. Sometimes it shoots high up into the air. Lava rivers quickly form and travel down the sides of the volcano. They are a grave danger to those who live on or around the volcano. Lava sets trees and houses on fire. If the flow is fast, people can die if they don’t get out of the way in time.\n","\n","Kilauea is a special volcano because it is on what used to be a small island. As lava rivers run into the ocean, it cools, hardens, and becomes earth, expanding the size of the island. In fact, all Hawaiian Islands were formed from the eruption of volcanoes.'''.capitalize(),\n","'''The first thing I do every morning, before I stretch or get out of bed, is rub my eyes three times with closed fists. Then I get out of bed and tap my right big toe on the floor three times before walking to the bathroom to brush my teeth.\n","\n","It’s not that I enjoy the odd habits or anything. I’m just used to them, and they’re kind of a part of me. As I brush my teeth, I look at myself in the mirror. I like to inventory things about me that relate to my family. I have light green eyes and thick eyebrows like my dad’s, a short nose like my mom’s, and a ton of freckles, like my older brother Joey. If you look at my face closely, you will see that I am really not my own person. I’m just someone made up of the different parts of everyone else in my family.\n","\n","My friend Susanna says that’s kind of a morbid way of thinking about my life, but I don’t think she knows the correct way to use the word “morbid.”\n","\n","After I’m done brushing my teeth, I walk back to my bedroom, toe-to-heel, very slowly. Then I get dressed for school. We have to wear a uniform, so I wear the same thing every day: a blue and green plaid skirt with a navy blue polo shirt and black loafers. Susanna finds the uniform boring (she says it infringes on her self-identity), but I don’t mind it so much. It’s just one less thing I have to worry about in the morning.\n","\n","I eat the same thing for breakfast every day: oatmeal with bananas and a few spoonfuls of brown sugar. My mom prepares breakfast for Joey and me because our dad has usually already left for work by the time we’re ready for breakfast.\n","\n","Joey sits at the head of the table, and I sit at the foot of the table. He always reads the sports section of the newspaper, and I always get the front page.\n","\n","On the way to school, I buckle and unbuckle the seat belt two times. My mom doesn’t ever say anything, but my habit seems to really annoy Joey.\n","\n","“Rose, stop it!” he says, turning around to glare at me from the front seat.\n","\n","“Just ignore it!” I respond, and click once more.\n","\n","“Settle down, settle down,” Mom says.\n","\n","We are all quiet on the rest of the way to school. My mom says it takes her a while to wake up in the morning; otherwise she’d be chattier. I don’t mind though. It’s sometimes nice just to watch the streets go by out the car window, with the people walking along the sidewalks. We always listen to the same radio show, “The Darnell Owens Show,” whose emcees talk about movies. They especially love film noir.\n","\n","When we get to school, Joey slams the door behind him, and I reach between the front seats to give my mom a kiss good-bye.\n","\n","In school, I meet Susanna by our lockers. They’re right next to each other in a prime spot by our classroom, because Susanna complained to the principal that she didn’t feel comfortable “expressing herself” on the inside of her locker next to any other person in our grade. (Susanna’s dad is a lawyer, and her mom is an artist.)\n","\n","I open and close the locker three times before I reach inside to grab my books for social studies and math.\n","\n","Susanna is chattering on about this new painting she and her mom did in her mom’s studio when the long shadow of William Jones crosses over us.\n","\n","“Hey, freaks,” he says.\n","\n","Susanna and I glance at each other.\n","\n","“What do you want, William?” Susanna says defiantly.\n","\n","I’m always in such awe of her bravery. William started making fun of us when we were in first grade. That’s when my habit really picked up, and he noticed that I was tapping the doorway three times every time we left the classroom or sneezing three times, even when I didn’t have to. Well, Susanna started sticking up for me, which is how we became such great friends, but it only made things worse with William. Soon William started mimicking Susanna when she raised her hand to answer a question (which she did often), and mocking the way she walked, always with one hand on her hip.\n","\n","“Just wanted to say good morning. Just wanted to say good morning. Just wanted to say good morning,” he says, smiling and curling his lip. “Three times… Right, loser?”\n","\n","I shake my head and turn back to my locker, like what he says doesn’t hurt my feelings. I can’t help my habit—it just pops up when I least expect it. My mom says the people who make fun of me are ignorant, but she still takes me to see Dr. P. every week to try to help me get over my habit.\n","\n","“Doesn’t it get old?” Susanna asks.\n","\n","“Nope!” William bares his teeth at us and then walks into the classroom.\n","\n","“Just forget him,” Susanna says, patting me on the back. I’m glad Susanna is on my side.\n","\n","Joey and I take the bus home together after school. At the bus stop, Joey always gets off first. He’s supposed to wait for me to get off the bus before starting to walk home, but he rarely does. I end up walking a few yards behind him, watching his dirty backpack move up and down as he moves.\n","\n","Mom has a snack waiting for us when we get home—carrots and ranch dressing—and every day we have to eat it and then do our homework right away. Joey says he does his homework in his room, but he’s just playing video games. Mom lets him get away with it.\n","\n","I sit down at the kitchen table and pull my worksheets out of my backpack to start in on my math homework. Mom sits next to me, takes a carrot out of the plastic dish, and dips it in ranch.\n","\n","“How was school?”\n","\n","“It was okay. William was teasing me again.” Mom looks sad when I say this.\n","\n","“I’m sorry, sweetie. Things will get better,” she says.\n","\n","“I know,” I say. I do my homework and then go read in my room until it’s time for dinner.\n","\n","I wonder if I will ever “kick my habit,” as Dr. P. likes to say. Dr. P. thinks that my habit is something I can train myself to give up. She thinks that with a little bit of effort on my part and with lots of help from her, I can learn not to need my habit to feel comfortable. Most of the time, I believe her and even want to kick my habit. Maybe then, Joey wouldn’t be embarrassed of me, and William wouldn’t tease me. But without my habit, I don’t think that Susanna and I would have become friends. I also don’t think that I’d feel the same sense of happiness I feel when I touch things or do things three times. There’s something very back and forth about my relationship to my habit—I’m not sure I’m ready to give it up. Maybe someday in the future.\n","\n","“Rose, dinner!” Mom calls.\n","\n","I go to the bathroom, look at my face in the mirror, and wash my hands three times before going downstairs to eat.'''.capitalize(),\n","'''You’ve probably seen pictures, models, or movies about dinosaurs that lived millions of years ago.

Most fossils formed from the hard parts of organisms such as teeth, shells, and bones. They also form from things a plant or animal leaves behind, like a footprint, a leaf print, and even eggs.

There are many ways we can aggregate these methods into a single \"text ranking\" function to fully automate this process, such as normalizing or implementing a voting system. It's up to you which one you choose!\n","- Also, there are *maaaaaaaaany* different Reading Scores and Lexical Diversity methods out there! They all have their specificities, strengths and weaknesses, and some are better than others in specific contexts.
