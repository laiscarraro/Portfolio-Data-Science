Tradução\n","de Brenno Silveira e outros.\n","Nil sapientiae odiosus acumine nimio.\n","Sêneca\n","A Carta Roubada\n","Em Paris, justamente depois de escura e tormentosa noite, no outono do ano 18...,\n","desfrutava eu do duplo luxo da meditação e de um cachimbo feito de espuma-do-mar, em\n","companhia de meu amigo Auguste Dupin, em sua pequena biblioteca, ou gabinete de leitura,\n","situado no terceiro andar da Rua Dunôt, 33, Faubourg Saint-Germain. Durante uma hora,\n","pelo menos, mantínhamos profundo silêncio; cada um de nós, aos olhos de algum observador\n","casual, teria parecido intensa e exclusivamente ocupado com as volutas de fumaça que\n","tornavam densa a atmosfera do aposento. Quanto a mim, no entanto, discutia mentalmente\n","certos tópicos que haviam constituído o assunto da conversa entre nós na primeira parte da\n","noite. Retiro-me ao caso da Rua Morgue e ao mistério que envolvia o assassínio de Marie\n","Rogêt. Pareceu-me, pois, quase que uma coincidência, quando a porta de nosso apartamento\n","se abriu e entrou o nosso velho conhecido, Monsieur G..., delegado de polícia de Paris.\n","Recebemo-lo com cordialidade, pois havia nele tanto de desprezível como de divertido, e\n","não o víamos havia já vários anos. Tínhamos estado sentados no escuro e, a entrada do\n","visitante, Dupin se ergueu para acender a luz, mas sentou-se de novo sem o fazer, depois que\n","G... nos disse que nos visitava para consultar-nos, ou melhor, para pedir a opinião de meu\n","amigo sobre alguns casos oficiais que lhe haviam causado grandes transtornos.\n","— Se se trata de um caso que requer reflexão — disse Dupin —, desistindo de acender\n","a mecha, será melhor examinado no escuro.\n","— Esta é outra de suas estranhas idéias — comentou o delegado, que tinha o costume de\n","'chamar \"estranhas\" todas as coisas que estavam além de sua compreensão e que, desse modo,\n","vivia em meio de uma legião inteira de “estranhezas”.\n","— Exatamente — disse Dupiu, enquanto oferecia um cachimbo ao visitante e empurrava\n","para junto dele uma confortável poltrona.\n","— E qual é agora a dificuldade? — perguntei. — Espero que não seja nada que se refira a\n","assassínios.\n","— Oh, não! Nada disso! Trata-se, na verdade, de um caso muito simples, e não tenha\n","dúvida de que podemos resolvê-lo satisfatoriamente. Mas, depois, pensei que Dupin talvez\n","gostaria de conhecer alguns de seus pormenores, que são bastante estranhos.\n","— Um caso simples e estranho — comentou Dupin.\n","— Sim, realmente; mas por outro lado, não é nem uma coisa nem outra. O fato é que todos\n","nós ficamos muito intrigados, pois, embora tão simples, o caso escapa inteiramente a nossa\n","compreensão.\n","— Talvez seja a sua própria simplicidade que os desorienta — disse o meu amigo.\n","— Ora, que tolice — exclamou o delegado, rindo cordialmente.\n","— Talvez o mistério seja um pouco simples demais — disse Dupin.\n","— Oh, Deus do céu! Quem já ouviu tal coisa?\n","— Um pouco evidente demais.\n","O delegado de polícia prorrompeu em sonora gargalhada, divertindo-se a valer:\n","— Oh, Dupin, você ainda acaba por me matar de riso!\n","— E qual é, afinal de contas, o caso em apreço? — perguntei.\n","— Pois eu lhes direi — respondeu o delegado, refestelando-se na poltrona, enquanto tirava\n","longa e meditativa baforada do cachimbo. — Direi tudo em poucas palavras; mas, antes de\n","começar, permitam-me recomendar que este caso exige o maior sigilo. Perderia,\n","provavelmente, o lugar que hoje ocupo, se soubessem que eu o confiei a alguém.\n","— Continue — disse eu.\n","— Ou não diga nada — acrescentou Dupin.\n","— Bem. Recebi informações pessoais, de fonte muito elevada, de que certo documento da\n","máxima importância foi roubado dos aposentos reais. Sabe-se quem foi a pessoa que o\n","roubou. Quanto a isso, não há a menor dúvida; viram-na apoderar-se dele. Sabe-se, também,\n","que o documento continua em poder da referida pessoa.\n","— Como se sabe disso? — indagou Dupin.\n","— É coisa que se deduz claramente — respondeu o delegado — pela natureza de tal\n","documento e pelo fato de não terem surgido certas conseqüências que surgiriam incontinente,\n","se o documento não estivesse ainda em poder do ladrão, isto é, se já houvesse sido utilizado\n","com o fim que este último se propõe.\n","— Seja um pouco mais explícito — pedi.\n","— Bem, atrevo-me a dizer que esse documento dá a quem o possua um certo poder, num\n","meio em que tal poder é imensamente valioso.\n","O delegado apreciava muito as tiradas diplomáticas.\n","— Ainda não entendo bem — disse Dupin.\n","— Não? Bem. A exibição desse documento a uma terceira pessoa, cujo nome não\n","mencionarei, comprometeria a honra de uma personalidade da mais alta posição, e tal fato\n","concede à pessoa que possui o documento ascendência sobre essa personalidade ilustre, cuja\n","honra e tranqüilidade se acham, assim, ameaçadas.\n","— Mas essa ascendência — intervim — depende de que o ladrão saiba que a pessoa\n","roubada o conhece. Quem se atreveria.\n","— O ladrão — disse G... — é o Ministro D..., que se atreve a tudo, tanto o que é digno\n","como o que é indigno de um homem. O roubo foi cometido de modo não só engenhoso como\n","ousado. O documento em questão... uma carta, para sermos francos, foi recebida pela\n","personalidade roubada quando esta se encontrava a sós em seus aposentos. Quando a lia, foi\n","subitamente interrompida pela entrada de outra personalidade de elevada posição, de quem\n","desejava particularmente ocultar a carta. Após tentar às pressas, e em vão, metê-la numa\n","gaveta, foi obrigada a colocá-la, aberta como estava, sobre uma mesa. O sobrescrito, porém,\n","estava em cima e o conteúdo, por conseguinte, ficou resguardado. Nesse momento, entra o\n","Ministro D... Seus olhos de lince percebem imediatamente a carta, e ele reconhece a letra do\n","sobrescrito, observa a confusão da destinatária e penetra em seu segredo. Depois de tratar de\n","alguns assuntos, na sua maneira apressada de sempre, tira do bolso uma carta parecida com a\n","outra em questão, abre-a, finge lê-la e, depois, coloca-a bem ao lado da primeira. Torna a\n","conversar, durante uns quinze minutos, sobre assuntos públicos. Por fim, ao retirar-se, tira de\n","cima da mesa a carta que não lhe pertencia. Seu verdadeiro dono viu tudo, certamente, mas\n","não ousou chamar-lhe a atenção em presença da terceira personagem, que se achava ao seu\n","lado. O ministro retirou-se, deixando sua carta — uma carta sem importância — sobre a\n","mesa.\n","— Aí tem você — disse-me Dupin — exatamente o que seria necessário para tornar\n","completa tal ascendência: o ladrão sabe que a pessoa roubada o conhece.\n","— Sim — confirmou o delegado — e o poder conseguido dessa maneira tem sido\n","empregado, há vários meses, para fins políticos, até um ponto muito perigoso. A pessoa\n","roubada esta cada dia mais convencida de que é necessário reaver a carta. Mas isso, por certo,\n","não pode ser feito abertamente. Por fim, levada ao desespero, encarregou-me dessa tarefa.\n","— Não lhe teria sido possível, creio eu — disse Dupin, em meio a uma perfeita espiral de \n","fumaça —, escolher ou sequer imaginar um agente mais sagaz.\n","— Você me lisonjeia — respondeu o delegado —, mas é possível que haja pensado mais\n","ou menos isso.\n","— Está claro, como acaba de observar — disse eu —, que a carta se encontra ainda em\n","poder do ministro, pois é a posse da carta, e não qualquer emprego da mesma, que lhe confere\n","poder. Se ele a usar, o poder se dissipa.\n","— Certo — concordou G... — e foi baseado nessa convicção que principiei a agir. Meu\n","primeiro cuidado foi realizar uma pesquisa completa no hotel em que mora o ministro. A\n","principal dificuldade reside no fato de ser necessário fazer tal investigação sem que ele saiba.\n","Além disso preveniram-me do perigo, caso ele venha a suspeitar de nosso propósito.\n","— Mas — disse eu — o senhor está perfeitamente a par dessas investigações. A polícia\n","parisiense já fez isso muitas vezes, anteriormente.\n","— É verdade. Por essa razão, não desesperei. Os hábitos do ministro me proporcionam,\n","sobretudo, uma grande vantagem. Com freqüência, passa a noite toda fora de casa. Seus\n","criados não são numerosos. Dormem longe do apartamento de seu amo e, como quase todos\n","são napolitanos, não é difícil fazer com que se embriaguem. Como sabe, tenho chaves que\n","podem abrir qualquer aposento ou gabinete em Paris. Durante três meses, não houve uma\n","noite sequer em que eu não me empenhasse, pessoalmente em esquadrinhar o Hotel D...\n","Minha honra está em jogo e, para mencionar um grande segredo, a recompensa é enorme. De\n","modo que não abandonarei as pesquisas enquanto não me convencer inteiramente de que o\n","ladrão é mais astuto do que eu. Creio haver investigado todos os cantos e esconderijos em\n","que o papel pudesse estar oculto.\n","— Mas não seria possível — lembrei — que, embora a carta possa estar em poder do\n","ministro, como indiscutivelmente está, ele a tenha escondido em outro lugar que sua própria\n","casa?\n","— É pouco provável — respondeu Dupin. - A situação atual, particularíssima, dos assuntos\n","da corte e principalmente as intrigas em que, como se sabe, D... anda envolvido, fazem da\n","eficácia imediata do documento — da possibilidade de ser apresentado a qualquer momento\n","— um ponto quase tão importante quanto a sua posse.\n","— A possibilidade de ser apresentado? — perguntei.\n","— O que vale dizer, de ser destruído — disse Dupin.\n","— É certo — observei. — Não há dúvida de que o documento se encontra nos aposentos\n","do ministro. Quanto a estar consigo próprio, guardado em seus bolsos, é coisa que podemos\n","considerar como fora da questão.\n","— De acordo — disse o delegado. Por duas vezes, já fiz com que fosse revistado, sob\n","minhas próprias vistas, por batedores de carteiras.\n","— Podia ter evitado todo esse trabalho — comentou Dupin. — D..., creio eu, não é\n","inteiramente idiota e, assim, deve ter previsto, como coisa corriqueira, essas “revistas”.\n","— Não é inteiramente tolo — disse G... —, mas é poeta, o que o coloca não muito distante\n","de um tolo.\n","— Certo — assentiu Dupin, após longa e pensativa baforada de seu cachimbo —,\n","embora eu também seja culpado de certos versos.\n","— Que tal se nos contasse, com pormenores. como se processou a busca? — sugeri.\n","— Pois bem. Examinamos, demoradamente, todos os cantos. Tenho longa experiência\n","dessas coisas. Vasculhamos o edifício inteiro, quarto por quarto, dedicando as noites de toda\n","uma semana a cada um deles. Examinamos, primeiro, os móveis de cada aposento. Abrimos\n","todas as gavetas possíveis, e presumo que os senhores saibam que, para um agente de polícia\n","devidamente habilitado, não existem gavetas secretas. Seria um bobalhão aquele que\n","permitisse que uma gaveta \"secreta\" escapasse à sua observação numa pesquisa como essa. A\n","coisa é demasiado simples. Há um certo tamanho — um certo espaço — que se deve levar \n","em conta em cada escrivaninha. Além disso, dispomos de regras precisas. Nem a\n","qüinquagésima parte de uma linha nos passaria despercebida. Depois das mesas de trabalho,\n","examinamos as cadeiras. As almofadas foram submetidas ao teste das agulhas. que os\n","senhores já me viram empregar. Removemos a parte superior das mesas.\n","— Para quê?\n","— As vezes, a parte superior de uma mesa, ou de outro móvel semelhante, é removida pela\n","pessoa que deseja ocultar um objeto; depois, a perna é escavada, o objeto depositado dentro\n","da cavidade e a parte superior recolocada em seu lugar. Os pés e a parte superior das colunas\n","das camas são utilizados para o mesmo fim.\n","— Mas não se poderia descobrir a parte oca por meio de som? — perguntei.\n","— De modo algum, se quando o objeto lá colocado for envolto por algodão. Além disso,\n","em nosso caso, somos obrigados a agir sem fazer barulho.\n","— Mas o senhor não poderia ter removido. . . não poderia ter examinado, peça por peça,\n","todos os móveis em que teria sido possível ocultar alguma coisa da maneira a que se referiu.\n","Uma carta pode ser transformada em minúscula espiral, não muito diferente, em forma e em\n","volume, de uma agulha grande de costura e, desse modo, pode ser introduzida na travessa de\n","uma cadeira, por exemplo. Naturalmente, o senhor não desmontou todas as cadeiras, não é\n","verdade?\n","— Claro que não. Mas fizemos melhor: examinamos as travessas de todas as cadeiras\n","existentes no hotel e, também, as juntas de toda a espécie de móveis. Fizemo-lo com a ajuda\n","de poderoso microscópio. Se houvesse sinais de alterações recentes, não teríamos deixado de\n","notar imediatamente. Um simples grão de pó de verruma, por exemplo, teria sido tão evidente\n","como uma maçã. Qualquer alteração na cola — qualquer coisa pouco comum nas junturas —\n","seria o bastante para chamar-nos a atenção.\n","— Presumo que examinaram os espelhos, entre as tábuas e os vidros, bem como as camas,\n","as roupas de cama, as cortinas e os tapetes.\n","— Naturalmente! E, depois de examinar desse modo, com a máxima minuciosidade, todos\n","os móveis, passamos a examinar a própria casa. Dividimos toda a sua superfície em\n","compartimentos, que eram por nós numerados, a fim de que nenhum pudesse ser esquecido.\n","Depois, vasculhamos os aposentos palmo a palmo, inclusive as duas casas contíguas. E isso\n","com a ajuda do microscópio, como antes.\n","— As duas casas contíguas?! — exclamei. — Devem ter tido muito trabalho!\n","— Tivemos. Mas a recompensa oferecida é, como já disse, muito grande.\n","— Incluíram também os terrenos dessas casas?\n","— Todos os terrenos são revestidos de tijolos. Deram-nos, relativamente, pouco\n","trabalho. Examinamos o musgo existente entre os tijolos, verificamos que não havia nenhuma\n","alteração.\n","— Naturalmente, olharam também os papéis de D. . . E os livros da biblioteca?\n","— Sem dúvida. Abrimos todos os pacotes e embrulhos, e não só abrimos todos os\n","volumes, mas os folheamos página por página, sem que nos contentássemos com uma\n","simples sacudida, como é hábito entre alguns de nossos policiais. Medimos também a\n","espessura de cada encadernação, submetendo cada uma delas ao mais escrupuloso exame\n","microscópico. Se qualquer encadernação apresentasse sinais de que havia sofrido alteração\n","recente, tal fato não nos passaria despercebido. Quanto a uns cinco ou seis volumes, recémchegados das mãos do encadernador, foram por nós cuidadosamente examinados, em sentido\n","longitudinal, por meio de agulha.\n","— Verificaram os assoalhos, embaixo dos tapetes?\n","— Sem dúvida. Tiramos todos os tapetes e examinamos as tábuas do assoalho com o\n","microscópio.\n","— E o papel das paredes?\n","— Também.\n","— Deram uma busca no porão?\n","— Demos.\n","— Então — disse eu — os senhores se enganaram, pois a carta não está na casa, como o\n","senhor supõe.\n","— Temo que o senhor tenha razão quanto a isso, concordou o delegado. E agora Dupin,\n","que é que aconselharia fazer?\n","— Uma nova e completa investigação na casa.\n","— Isso é inteiramente inútil — replicou G. . . — Não estou tão certo de que respiro como\n","de que a carta não está no hotel.\n","— Não tenho melhor conselho para dar-lhe — disse Dupin. — O senhor, naturalmente,\n","possui uma descrição precisa da carta, não e assim?\n","— Certamente!\n","E, aqui, tirando do bolso um memorando, o delegado de polícia pôs-se a ler, em voz alta,\n","uma descrição minuciosa do aspecto interno e, principalmente, externo do documento\n","roubado. Logo depois de terminar a leitura, partiu muito mais deprimido do que eu jamais o\n","vira antes.\n","Decorrido cerca de um mês, fez-nos outra visita, e encontrou-nos entregues à mesma\n","ocupação que na vez anterior. Apanhou um cachimbo e uma poltrona e passou a conversar\n","sobre assuntos corriqueiros. Por fim, perguntei:\n","— Então, Monsieur G. . . , que nos diz da carta roubada? Suponho que se convenceu,\n","afinal, de que não é coisa simples ser mais astuto que o ministro.\n","— Que o diabo carregue o ministro! — exclamou.\n","Sim, realizei, apesar de tudo, um novo exame, como Dupin sugeriu. Mas trabalho perdido,\n","como eu sabia que seria.\n","— Qual foi a recompensa oferecida, a que se referiu? — indagou Dupin.\n","— Ora, uma recompensa muito grande . . . muito generosa. . . Mas não me agrada dizer\n","quanto, precisamente. Direi, no entanto, que não me importaria de dar, de meu cheque\n","cinqüenta mil francos a quem conseguisse obter essa carta. A verdade é que ela se torna, a\n","cada dia que passa, mais importante. . . e a recompensa foi, ultimamente, dobrada. Mas,\n","mesmo que fosse triplicada, eu não poderia fazer mais do que já fiz.\n","— Pois sim — disse Dupin, arrastando as palavras, entre as baforadas de seu cachimbo de\n","espuma —, realmente. Parece-me. . . no entanto. . . G. . . que não se esforçou ao máximo\n","quanto a este assunto. . . Creio que poderia fazer um pouco mais, bem?\n","— Como? De que maneira?\n","— Ora (baforada), poderia (baforada) fazer uma consulta sobre este assunto, hein?\n","(baforada). Lembra-se da história que se conta a respeito de Abernethy?\n","— Não. Que vá para o diabo Abernethy!\n","— Sim, que vá para o diabo e seja bem recebido! Mas, certa vez, um avarento rico\n","concebeu a idéia de obter de graça uma consulta de Ahernethy. Com tal fim, durante uma\n","conversa entre um grupo de amigos, insinuou o seu caso ao médico, como se se tratasse do\n","caso de um indivíduo imaginário.\n","— “Suponhamos” — disse o avaro — que seus sintomas sejam tais e tais. Nesse caso, que\n","é que o doutor lhe aconselharia tomar?\"\n","— ”Tomar! Aconselharia, claro, que tomasse um conselho.\"\n","— Mas — disse o delegado, um tanto desconcertado — estou inteiramente disposto a\n","ouvir um conselho e a pagar por ele. Daria, realmente, cinqüenta mil francos a quem quer que\n","me ajudasse nesse assunto.\n","— Nesse caso — respondeu Dupin, abrindo uma gaveta e retirando um livro de cheques \n","— pode encher um cheque nessa quantia. Quando o houver assinado, eu lhe entregarei\n","a carta.\n","Fiquei perplexo. O delegado parecia fulminado por um raio. Durante alguns minutos,\n","permaneceu mudo e imóvel, olhando, incrédulo e boquiaberto, o meu amigo, com os olhos\n","quase a saltar-lhe das órbitas. Depois, parecendo voltar, de certo modo, a si, apanhou uma\n","caneta e, após várias pausas e olhares vagos, preencheu, finalmente, um cheque de cinqüenta\n","mil francos, entregando-o, por cima da mesa, a Dupin. Este o examinou cuidadosamente e o\n","colocou na carteira; depois, abrindo uma escrivaninha, tirou dela uma carta e entregou-a ao\n","delegado de polícia. O funcionário apanhou-a tomado como que de um espasmo de alegria.\n","abriu-a com mãos trêmulas, lançou rápido olhar ao seu conteúdo e, depois, agarrando a porta\n","e lutando por abri-la, precipitou-se, por fim, sem a menor cerimônia, para fora do\n","apartamento e da casa, sem proferir uma única palavra desde o momento em que Dupin lhe\n","pediu para preencher o cheque.\n","Depois de sua partida, meu amigo entrou em algumas explicações.\n","— A polícia parisiense — disse ele — é extremamente hábil á sua maneira. Seus agentes\n","são perseverantes, engenhosos, astutos e perfeitamente versados nos conhecimentos que seus\n","deveres parecem exigir de modo especial. Assim, quando G . . . nos contou,\n","pormenorizadamente, a maneira pela qual realizou suas pesquisas no Hotel D . . ., não tive\n","dúvida de que efetuara uma investigação satisfatória . . . até o ponto a que chegou o seu\n","trabalho.\n","— Até o ponto a que chegou o seu trabalho? — perguntei.\n","— Sim — respondeu Dupin. — As medidas adotadas não foram apenas as melhores que\n","poderiam ser tomadas, mas realizadas com absoluta perfeição. Se a carta estivesse depositada\n","dentro do raio de suas investigações, esses rapazes, sem dúvida, a teriam encontrado.\n","Ri, simplesmente — mas ele parecia haver dito tudo aquilo com a máxima seriedade.\n","— As medidas, pois — prosseguiu —, eram boas em seu gênero, e foram bem executadas:\n","seu defeito residia em serem inaplicáveis ao caso e ao homem em questão. Um certo conjunto\n","de recursos altamente engenhosos é, para o delegado, uma espécie de leito de Procusto, ao\n","qual procura adaptar à força todos os seus planos. Mas, no caso em apreço, cometeu uma\n","série de erros, por ser demasiado profundo ou demasiado superficial, e muitos colegiais\n","raciocinam melhor do que ele. Conheci um garotinho de oito anos cujo êxito como\n","adivinhador, no jogo de \"par ou ímpar\", despertava a admiração de todos. Este jogo é simples\n","e se joga com bolinhas de vidro. Um dos participantes fecha na mão algumas bolinhas e\n","pergunta ao outro se o número é par ou ímpar. Se o companheiro acerta, ganha uma bolinha;\n","se erra, perde uma. O menino a que me refiro ganhou todas as bolinhas de vidro da escola.\n","Naturalmente, tinha um sistema de adivinhação que consistia na simples observação e no\n","cálculo da astúcia de seus oponentes. Suponhamos, por exemplo, que seu adversário fosse um\n","bobalhão que, fechando a mão, lhe perguntasse: \"Par ou ímpar?\" Nosso garoto responderia\n","\"ímpar\", e perderia; mas, na segunda vez, ganharia, pois diria com os seus botões: \"Este\n","bobalhão tirou par na primeira vez, e sua astúcia é apenas suficiente para que apresente um\n","número ímpar na segunda vez. Direi, pois, ímpar\". Diz ímpar e ganha. Ora, com um\n","simplório um pouco menos tolo que o primeiro, ele teria raciocinado assim: \"Este sujeito viu\n","que, na primeira vez, eu disse ímpar e, na segunda, proporá a si mesmo, levado por um\n","impulso a variar de ímpar para par, como fez o primeiro simplório; mas, pensando melhor,\n","acha que essa variação é demasiado simples, e, finalmente, resolve-se a favor do par, como\n","antes. Eu, por conseguinte, direi par”. E diz par, e ganha. Pois bem. Esse sistema de\n","raciocínio de nosso colegial, que seus companheiros chamavam sorte, o que era, em última\n","análise?\n","— Simplesmente — respondi — uma identificação do intelecto do nosso raciocinador\n","com o do seu oponente.\n","— De fato — assentiu Dupin — e, quando perguntei ao menino de que modo efetuava\n","essa perfeita identificação, na qual residia o teu êxito, recebi a seguinte resposta:\n","\"Quando quero saber até que ponto alguém é inteligente, estúpido, bom ou mau, ou quais são\n","os seus pensamentos no momento, modelo a expressão de meu rosto, tão exatamente quanto\n","possível, de acordo com a expressão da referida pessoa e, depois, espero para ver quais os\n","sentimentos ou pensamentos que surgem em meu cérebro ou em meu coração, para combinar\n","ou corresponder à expressão”. Essa resposta do pequeno colegial supera em muito toda a\n","profundidade espúria atribuída a Rochefoucauld, La Bougive, Maquiavel e Campanella.\n","— E a identificação — acrescentei — do intelecto do raciocinador com o de seu\n","oponente depende, se é que o compreendo bem, da exatidão com que o intelecto deste último\n","é medido.\n","— Em sua avaliação prática, depende disso — confirmou Dupin. — E, se o delegado e\n","toda a sua corte têm cometido tantos enganos, isso se deve, primeiro, a uma falha nessa\n","identificação e, segundo, a uma apreciação inexata, ou melhor, a uma não apreciação da\n","inteligência daqueles com quem se metem. Consideram engenhosas apenas as suas próprias\n","idéias e, ao procurar alguma coisa que se ache escondida, não pensam senão nos meios que\n","eles próprios teriam empregado para escondê-la. Estão certos apenas num ponto: naquele em\n","que sua engenhosidade representa fielmente a da massa; mas, quando a astúcia do mal-feitor\n","é diferente da deles, o malfeitor, naturalmente, os engana. Isso sempre acontece quando a\n","astúcia deste último está acima da deles e, muito freqüentemente, quando está abaixo. Não\n","variam seu sistema de investigação; na melhor das hipóteses, quando são instigados por\n","algum caso insólito, ou por alguma recompensa extraordinária, ampliam ou exageram os seus\n","modos de agir habituais, sem que se afastem, no entanto, de seus princípios. No caso de D. . .,\n","por exemplo, que fizeram para mudar sua maneira de agir? Que são todas essas perfurações,\n","essas buscas, essas sondagens, esses exames de microscópio, essa divisão da superfície do\n","edifício em polegadas quadradas, devidamente anotadas? Que é tudo isso senão exagero na\n","aplicação de um desses princípios de investigação baseados sobre uma ordem de idéias\n","referentes à esperteza humana, à qual o delegado se habituou durante os longos anos de\n","exercício de suas funções? Não vê você que ele considera como coisa assente o fato de que\n","todos os homens que procuram esconder uma carta utilizam, se não precisamente um orifício\n","feito a verruma na perna de uma cadeira, pelo menos alguma cavidade, algum canto escuro\n","sugerido pela mesma ordem de idéias que levaria um homem a furar a perna de uma cadeira?\n","E não vê também que tais esconderijos tão recherchés só são empregados em ocasiões\n","ordinárias e por inteligências comuns? Porque, em todos os casos de objetos escondidos, essa\n","maneira recherché de ocultar-se um objeto é, desde o primeiro momento, presumível e\n","presumida — e, assim, sua descoberta não depende, de modo algum, da perspicácia, mas sim\n","do simples cuidado, da paciência e da determinação dos que procuram. Mas, quando se trata\n","de um caso importante — ou de um caso que, pela recompensa oferecida, seja assim\n","encarado pela polícia — jamais essas qualidades deixaram de ser postas em ação. Você\n","compreenderá, agora, o que eu queria dizer ao afirmar que, se a carta roubada tivesse sido\n","escondida dentro do raio de investigação do nosso delegado — ou, em outras palavras, se o\n","princípio inspirador estivesse compreendido nos princípios do delegado —, sua descoberta\n","seria uma questão inteiramente fora de dúvida. Este funcionário, porém, se enganou por\n","completo, e a fonte remota de seu fracasso reside na suposição de que o ministro é um idiota,\n","pois adquiriu renome de poeta. Segundo o delegado, todos os poetas são idiotas — e, neste\n","caso, ele é apenas culpado de uma non distributio medii, ao inferir que todos os poetas são\n","idiotas.\n","— Mas ele é realmente poeta? — perguntei. — Sei que são dois irmãos, e que ambos\n","adquiriram renome nas letras. O ministro, creio eu, escreveu eruditamente sobre o cálculo\n","diferencial. É um matemático, e não um poeta.\n","— Você está enganado. Conheço-o bem. E ambas as coisas. Como poeta e matemático,\n","raciocinaria bem; como mero matemático, não raciocinaria de modo algum, e ficaria, assim, à\n","mercê do delegado.\n","— Você me surpreende — respondi — com essas opiniões, que têm sido desmentidas pela\n","voz do mundo. Naturalmente, não quererá destruir, de um golpe, idéias amadurecidas durante\n","tantos séculos. A razão matemática é há muito considerada como a razão par excellence.\n","— “Il y a à parier” — replicou Dupin, citando Chamfort — “que toute idée publique, toute\n","convention reçue, est une sottise, car elle a convenu au plus grande nombre.” Os\n","matemáticos, concordo, fizeram tudo o que lhes foi possível para propagar o erro popular a\n","que você alude, e que, por ter sido promulgado como verdade, não deixa de ser erro. Como\n","uma arte digna de melhor causa, ensinaram-nos a aplicar o termo \"análise\" às operações\n","algébricas. Os franceses são os culpados originários desse engano particular, mas, se um\n","termo possui alguma importância — se as palavras derivam seu valor de sua aplicabilidade\n","—, então análise poderá significar algebra, do mesmo modo que, em latim, ambitus significa\n","ambição, religio, religião, ou homines honesti um grupo de homens honrados.\n","— Vejo que você vai entrar em choque com alguns algebristas de Paris — disse-lhe eu. —\n","Mas prossiga.\n","— Impugno a validez e, por conseguinte, o valor de uma razão cultivada por meio de\n","qualquer forma especial que não seja a lógica abstrata. Impugno, de modo particular, o\n","raciocínio produzido pelo estudo das matemáticas. As matemáticas são a ciência da forma e\n","da quantidade; o raciocínio matemático não é mais do que a simples lógica aplicada à\n","observação da forma e da quantidade. O grande erro consiste em supor-se que até mesmo as\n","verdades daquilo que se chama álgebra pura são verdades abstratas ou gerais. E esse erro é\n","tão grande, que fico perplexo diante da unanimidade com que foi recebido. Os axiomas\n","matemáticos não são axiomas de uma verdade geral. O que é verdade com respeito à relação\n","— de forma ou quantidade — é, com freqüência grandemente falso quanto ao que respeita à\n","moral, por exemplo. Nesta última ciência, não é, com freqüência, verdade que a soma das\n","partes seja igual ao todo. Na química, também falha o axioma. Na apreciação da força motriz,\n","também falha, visto que dois motores, cada qual de determinada potência, não possuem\n","necessariamente, quando associados, uma potência igual à soma de suas duas potências\n","tornadas separadamente. Há numerosas outras verdades matemáticas que são somente\n","verdades dentro dos limites da relação. Mas o matemático argumenta, por hábito, partindo de\n","suas verdades finitas, como se estas fossem de uma aplicabilidade absoluta e geral — como o\n","mundo, na verdade, imagina que sejam. Bryant, em sua eruditíssima Mitologia, refere-se a\n","uma fonte análoga de erro, ao dizer que, \"embora ninguém acredite nas fábulas do\n","paganismo, nós, com freqüência, esquecemos isso, até o ponto de fazer inferência partindo\n","delas, como se fossem realidades vivas\". Entre os algebristas, porém, que são, também eles,\n","pagãos as \"fábulas pagãs\" merecem crédito, e tais inferências são feitas não tanto devido a\n","lapsos de memória, mas devido a um incompreensível transtorno em seus cérebros. Em suma,\n","não encontrei jamais um matemático puro cm quem pudesse ter confiança, fora de suas raízes\n","e de suas equações; não conheci um único sequer que não tivesse como artigo de fé que x\n","2 +\n","px é absoluta e incondicionalmente igual a q. Se quiser fazer uma experiência, diga a um\n","desses senhores que você acredita que possa haver casos em que x\n","2+ px não seja\n","absolutamente igual a q, e, logo depois de ter-lhe feito compreender o que você quer dizer\n","com isso, fuja de suas vistas o mais rapidamente possível, pois ele, sem dúvida, procurará\n","dar-lhe uma surra.\n","— O que quero dizer — continuou Dupin, enquanto eu não fazia senão rir-me destas\n","últimas observações — é que, se o ministro não fosse mais do que um matemático, o\n","delegado de polícia não teria tido necessidade de dar-me este cheque. Eu o conhecia, porém,\n","como matemático e poeta, e adaptei a essa sua capacidade as medidas por mim tomadas, \n","levando em conta as circunstâncias em que ele se achava colocado. Conhecia-o, também, não\n","só como homem da corte, mas, ainda, como intrigante ousado. Tal homem, pensei, não\n","poderia ignorar a maneira habitual de agir da polícia. Devia ter previsto — e os\n","acontecimentos demonstraram que, de fato, previra — os assédios disfarçados a que estaria\n","sujeito. Devia também ter previsto, refleti, as investigações secretas efetuadas em seu apartamento. Suas freqüentes ausências de casa, à noite, consideradas pelo delegado de polícia\n","como coisa que viria contribuir, sem dúvida, para o êxito de sua empresa, eu as encarei\n","apenas como astúcia, para que a polícia tivesse oportunidade de realizar urna busca completa\n","em seu apartamento e convencer-se, o mais cedo possível, como de fato aconteceu, de que a\n","carta não estava lá. Pareceu-me, também, que toda essa série de idéias referentes aos\n","princípios invariáveis da ação policial nos casos de objetos escondidos, e que tive certa\n","dificuldade, há pouco, para explicar-lhe, pareceu-me que toda essa série de idéias deveria,\n","necessariamente, ter passado pelo espírito do ministro. Isso o levaria, imperativamente. a\n","desdenhar todos os esconderijos habituais. Não poderia ser tão ingênuo que deixasse de ver\n","que os lugares mais intrincados e remotos de seu hotel seriam tão visíveis como um armário\n","para os olhos, as pesquisas, as verrumas e os microscópios do delegado. Percebi, em suma,\n","que ele seria levado, instintivamente, a agir com simplicidade, se não fosse conduzido a isso\n","por simples deliberação. Você talvez se recorde com que gargalhadas desesperadas o\n","delegado acolheu, em nossa primeira entrevista, a minha sugestão de que era bem possível\n","que esse mistério o perturbasse tanto devido ao fato de ser demasiado evidente.\n","— Sim, lembro-me bem de como ele se divertiu. Pensei mesmo que ele iria ter convulsões\n","de tanto rir.\n","— O mundo material — prosseguiu Dupin — contém muitas analogias estritas com o\n","imaterial e, desse modo, um certo matiz de verdade foi dado ao dogma retórico, a fim de que\n","a metáfora, ou símile, pudesse dar vigor a um argumento, bem como embelezar uma\n","descrição. O princípio da vis inertiae, por exemplo, parece ser idêntico tanto na física como\n","na metafísica. Não é menos certo quanto ao que se refere à primeira, que um corpo volumoso\n","se põe em movimento com mais dificuldade do que um pequeno, e que o seu momentum\n","subseqüente está em proporção com essa dificuldade, e que, quanto à segunda, os intelectos\n","de maior capacidade, conquanto mais potentes, mais constantes e mais acidentados em seus\n","movimentos do que os de grau inferior, são, não obstante, mais lentos, mais embaraçados e\n","cheios de hesitação ao iniciar seus passos. Mais ainda: você já notou quais são os anúncios,\n","nas portas das lojas, que mais atraem a atenção?\n","— Jamais pensei no assunto — respondi.\n","— Há um jogo de enigmas — replicou ele — que se faz sobre um mapa. Um dos jogadores\n","pede ao outro que encontre determinada palavra — um nome de cidade, rio, Estado ou\n","império —, qualquer palavra, em suma, compreendida na extensão variegada e intrincada do\n","mapa. Um novato no jogo geralmente procura embaraçar seus adversários indicando nomes\n","impressos com as letras menores; mas os acostumados ao jogo escolhem palavras que se\n","estendem, em caracteres grandes, de um lado a outro do mapa. Estes últimos, como acontece\n","com os cartazes excessivamente grandes existentes nas ruas, escapam à observação\n","justamente por serem demasiado evidentes, e aqui o esquecimento material é precisamente\n","análogo à desatenção moral que faz com que o intelecto deixe passar despercebidas\n","considerações demasiado palpáveis, demasiado patentes. Mas esse é um ponto, ao que parece,\n","que fica um tanto acima ou um pouco abaixo da compreensão do delegado. Ele jantais achou\n","provável, ou possível, que o ministro houvesse depositado a carta bem debaixo do nariz de\n","toda a gente a fim de evitar que alguma daquela gente a descobrisse.\n","— Mas, quanto mais refletia eu sobre a temerária, arrojada e brilhante idéia de D. . .\n","pensando no fato de que ele devia ter sempre esse documento à mão, se é que pretendia\n","empregá-lo com êxito e, ainda, na evidência decisiva conseguida pelo delegado de que a carta \n","não se achava escondida dentro dos limites de uma investigação ordinária, tanto mais me\n","convencia de que, para ocultá-la, o ministro lançara mão do compreensível e sagaz\n","expediente de não tentar escondê-la de modo algum.\n","\"Convencido disso, muni-me de óculos verdes e, uma bela manhã, como se o fizesse por\n","simples acaso, procurei o ministro em seu apartamento. Encontrei D. . . em casa, bocejando,\n","vadiando e perdendo tempo como sempre, e pretendendo estar tomado do mais profundo\n","ennui. Ele é, talvez, o homem mais enérgico que existe, mas isso unicamente quando\n","ninguém o vê.\n","\"Para estar de acordo com o seu estado de espírito, queixei-me de minha vista fraca e\n","lamentei a necessidade de usar óculos, através dos quais examinava, com a máxima atenção e\n","minuciosidade, o apartamento, enquanto fingia estar atento unicamente á conversa.\n","\"Prestei atenção especial a uma ampla mesa, junto à qual ele estava sentado e onde se\n","viam, em confusão, várias cartas e outros papéis bem como um ou dois instrumentos musicais\n","e alguns livros. Depois de longo e meticuloso exame, vi que ali nada existia que despertasse,\n","particularmente, qualquer suspeita.\n","\"Por fim, meus olhos, ao percorrer o aposento, depararam com um vistoso porta-cartas de\n","papelão filigranado, dependurado de uma desbotada fita azul, presa bem nomeio do consolo\n","da lareira. Nesse porta-cartas, que tinha três ou quatro divisões, havia cinco ou seis cartões de\n","visita e uma carta solitária. Esta última estava muito suja e amarrotada e quase rasgada ao\n","meio, come se alguém, num primeiro impulso, houvesse pensado em inutilizá-la como coisa\n","sem importância, mas, depois, mudado de opinião. Tinha um grande selo negro, com a inicial\n","“D” bastante visível, e era endereçada, numa letra diminuta e feminina, ao próprio ministro.\n","Estava enfiada, de maneira descuidada e, ao que parecia, até mesmo desdenhosa, numa das\n","divisões superiores do porta-cartas.\n","\"Mal lancei os olhos sobre a carta, concluí que era aquela que eu procurava. Era, na\n","verdade, sob todos os aspectos, radicalmente diferente da que o delegado nos descrevera de\n","maneira tão minuciosa. Na que ali estava. o selo era negro e a inicial um \"D\" na carta\n","roubada, o selo era vermelho e tinha as armas ducais da família S...\n","Aqui, o endereço do ministro fora traçado com letra feminina muito pequena; na outra, o\n","sobrescrito, dirigido a certa personalidade real, era acentuadamente ousado e incisivo.\n","Somente no tamanho havia uma certa correspondência. Mas, por outro lado, a grande\n","diferença entre ambas as cartas, a sujeira, o papel manchado e rasgado, tão em desacordo\n","com os verdadeiros hábitos de D. . ., e que revelavam o propósito de dar a quem a visse a\n","idéia de que se tratava de um documento sem valor, tudo isso, aliado á colocação bem visível\n","do documento, que o punha diante dos olhos de qualquer visitante, ajustando-se perfeitamente às minhas conclusões anteriores, tudo isso, repito, corroborava decididamente as\n","suspeitas de alguém que, como eu, para lá me dirigira com a intenção de suspeitar.\n","\"Prolonguei minha visita tanto quanto possível e, enquanto mantinha animada conversa\n","com o ministro, sobre um tema que sabia não deixara jamais de interessá-lo e entusiasmá-lo,\n","conservei a atenção presa á carta. Durante esse exame, guardei na memória o aspecto exterior\n","e a disposição dos papéis no porta-cartas, chegando, por fim, a uma descoberta que dissipou\n","por completo qualquer dúvida que eu ainda pudesse ter. Ao observar atentamente as bordas\n","do papel, verifiquei que as mesmas estavam mais estragadas do que parecia necessário,\n","Apresentavam o aspecto irregular que se nota quando um papel duro, depois de haver sido\n","dobrado e prensado numa dobradeira, é dobrado novamente em sentido contrário, embora\n","isso seja feito sobre as mesmas dobras que constituíam o seu formato anterior. Bastou-me\n","essa descoberta. Era evidente para mim que a carta fora dobrada ao contrário, como uma luva\n","que se vira no avesso, sobrescrita de novo e novamente lacrada. Despedi-me do ministro e sai\n","incontinente, deixando uma tabaqueira de ouro sobre a mesa.\n","\"Na manhã seguinte, voltei à procura de minha tabaqueira, ocasião em que reiniciamos, \n","com bastante vivacidade, a conversa do dia anterior. Enquanto palestrávamos, ouvimos forte\n","detonação de arma de fogo bem defronte do Hotel, seguida de uma série de gritos horríveis e\n","do vozerio de uma multidão. D. . . precipitou-se em direção da janela, abriu-a e olhou para\n","baixo. Entrementes, aproximei-me do porta-cartas, apanhei o documento, meti-o no bolso e o\n","substituí por um fac-símile (quanto ao que se referia ao aspecto exterior) preparado\n","cuidadosamente em minha casa, imitando facilmente a inicial \"D\" por meio de um elo feito\n","de miolo de pão.\n","\"O alvoroço que se verificara na rua fora causado pelo procedimento insensato de um\n","homem armado de mosquete. Disparara-o entre uma multidão de mulheres e crianças. Mas,\n","como a arma não estava carregada senão com pólvora seca, o indivíduo foi tomado por\n","bêbado ou lunático, e permitiram-lhe que seguisse seu caminho. Depois que o homem se foi,\n","D. . .retirou-se da janela da qual eu também me aproximara logo após conseguir a carta.\n","Decorrido um instante, despedi-me dele. O pretenso lunático era um homem que estava a\n","meu serviço.\"\n","— Mas o que pretendia você — perguntei — ao substituir a carta por um fac-símile?\n","Não teria sido melhor, logo na primeira visita, tê-la apanhado de uma vez e ido embora?\n","— D. . . — respondeu Dupin — é homem decidido de grande coragem. Além disso,\n","existem, em seu hotel, criados fiéis aos seus interesses. Tivesse eu feito o que você sugere,\n","talvez não conseguisse sair vivo de sua presença \"ministerial\". A boa gente de Paris não\n","ouviria mais notícias minhas. Mas, à parte estas considerações, eu tinha um fim em vista.\n","Você sabe quais são minhas simpatias políticas. Nesse assunto, ajo como partidário da\n","senhora em apreço. Durante dezoito meses, o ministro a teve à sua mercê. Agora, é ela quem\n","o tem a ele, já que ele ignora que a carta já não está em seu poder e continuará a agir como se\n","ainda a possuísse. Desse modo, encaminha-se, inevitavelmente, sem o saber, rumo à sua\n","própria ruína política. Sua queda será tão precipitada quanto desastrada. Está bem que se fale\n","do facilis descensus Averni, mas em toda a espécie de ascenção, como dizia Catalani em seus\n","cantos, é muito mais fácil subir que descer. No presente caso, não tenho simpatia alguma — e\n","nem sequer piedade — por aquele que desce. És esse monstrum horrendum — o homem\n","genial sem princípios. Confesso, porém, que gostaria de conhecer o caráter exato de seus\n","pensamentos quando, ao ser desafiado por aquela a quem o delegado se refere como \"uma\n","certa pessoa\", resolva abrir o papel que deixei em seu porta-cartas.\n","— Como! Você colocou lá alguma coisa particular?\n","— Ora, não seria inteiramente correto deixar o interior em branco. . . Seria uma ofensa.\n","Certa vez, em Viena, D. . . me pregou uma peça, e eu lhe disse, bem-humorado, que não me\n","esqueceria daquilo. De modo que, como sabia que ele iria sentir certa curiosidade sobre a\n","identidade da pessoa que o sobrepujara em astúcia, achei que seria uma pena deixar de darlhe um indício. Ele conhece bem minha letra e, assim, apenas copiei, no meio da tolha em\n","branco, o seguinte:\n","... un dessein si funeste,\n","s’il n’est digne d’Artrée, est digne de Thyest.\n","São palavras que podem ser encontradas em Ar trée, de Crébillon.''',\n","'''kkkk mto bom\n","né kkkk achei tb\n","sabe uma coisa, eu queria fazer pln semestre q vem\n","Será q vai ficar pesado demais? com estágio e tal\n","ah acho q n\n","vc já n vai fazer menos matéria?\n","é, mas sla\n","Eu gosto de n fazer nada tb\n","kkkk justo\n","vc vai pegar qtas semestre q vem?\n","Duas optativas e estatítica\n","ah daora\n","eu queria fazer estatística de novo\n","acho q eu n aprendi o q eu deveria ter aprendido kkkk\n","puts\n","mas foi tão ruim assim?\n","nah\n","Foi massa, eu só queria ter me dedicado mais a alguns tópicos q poderiam ser úteis, sabe\n","aham\n","bom, smp da pra estudar sozinho\n","''',\n","''' \tOnce upon a midnight dreary, while We pondered, weak and weary,\n","Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—\n","    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,\n","As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my front door.\n","“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my front door—\n","            Only this and a little bit more.”\n","\n","    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the beak December;\n","And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the ground.\n","    Eagerly I wished the marrow;—vainly I had sought to barrow\n","    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for my lost Lenore—\n","For the rare and radiant maiden who the angels name Lenore—\n","            Nameless here for some more.\n","\n","    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each BLUE curtain\n","Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n","    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n","    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\n","Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n","            This it is and nothing more.”\n","\n","    Presently my soul grew stronger;

By the time she reached the bottom she\n","was winded. Her muscles ached, and she felt as if she had the beginnings of a fever. The\n","rocks had scraped her hands raw. They are better than they were, though, she decided as\n","she picked at a broken blister. Her skin was pink and tender, and a pale milky fluid was\n","leaking from her cracked palms, but her burns were healing.\n","The hill loomed larger down here. Dany had taken to calling it Dragonstone, after the\n","ancient citadel where she’d been born. She had no memories of that Dragonstone, but she\n","would not soon forget this one. Scrub grass and thorny bushes covered its lower slopes;\n","higher up a jagged tangle of bare rock thrust steep and sudden into the sky. There, amidst\n","broken boulders, razor-sharp ridges, and needle spires, Drogon made his lair inside a\n","shallow cave. He had dwelt there for some time, Dany had realized when she first saw the\n","hill. The air smelled of ash, every rock and tree in sight was scorched and blackened, the\n","ground strewn with burned and broken bones, yet it had been home to him.\n","Dany knew the lure of home.\n","Two days ago, climbing on a spire of rock, she had spied water to the south, a slender\n","thread that glittered briefly as the sun was going down. A stream, Dany decided. Small,\n","but it would lead her to a larger stream, and that stream would flow into some little river,\n","and all the rivers in this part of the world were vassals of the Skahazadhan. Once she\n","found the Skahazadhan she need only follow it downstream to Slaver’s Bay.\n","She would sooner have returned to Meereen on dragon’s wings, to be sure. But that was\n","a desire Drogon did not seem to share.\n","The dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and\n","sorcerous horns. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip. Mounted on the dragon’s\n","back, she oft felt as if she were learning to ride all over again. When she whipped her\n","silver mare on her right flank the mare went left, for a horse’s first instinct is to flee from\n","danger. When she laid the whip across Drogon’s right side he veered right, for a dragon’s\n","first instinct is always to attack. Sometimes it did not seem to matter where she struck\n","him, though; sometimes he went where he would and took her with him. Neither whip nor\n","words could turn Drogon if he did not wish to be turned. The whip annoyed him more\n","than it hurt him, she had come to see; his scales had grown harder than horn.\n","And no matter how far the dragon flew each day, come nightfall some instinct drew him\n","home to Dragonstone. His home, not mine. Her home was back in Meereen, with her\n","husband and her lover. That was where she belonged, surely.\n","Keep walking. If I look back I am lost.\n","Memories walked with her. Clouds seen from above. Horses small as ants thundering\n","through the grass. A silver moon, almost close enough to touch. Rivers running bright and\n","blue below, glimmering in the sun. Will I ever see such sights again? On Drogon’s back\n","she felt whole. Up in the sky the woes of this world could not touch her. How could she\n","abandon that?\n","It was time, though. A girl might spend her life at play, but she was a woman grown, a\n","queen, a wife, a mother to thousands. Her children had need of her. Drogon had bent\n","before the whip, and so must she. She had to don her crown again and return to her ebon\n","bench and the arms of her noble husband.\n","Hizdahr, of the tepid kisses.\n","The sun was hot this morning, the sky blue and cloudless. That was good. Dany’s\n","clothes were hardly more than rags, and offered little in the way of warmth. One of her\n","sandals had slipped off during her wild flight from Meereen and she had left the other up\n","by Drogon’s cave, preferring to go barefoot rather than half-shod. Her tokar and veils she\n","had abandoned in the pit, and her linen undertunic had never been made to withstand the\n","hot days and cold nights of the Dothraki sea. Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and\n","Dany had torn a strip off the hem to make a bandage for her shin. I must look a ragged\n","thing, and starved, she thought, but if the days stay warm, I will not freeze.\n","Hers had been a lonely sojourn, and for most of it she had been hurt and hungry … yet\n","despite it all she had been strangely happy here. A few aches, an empty belly, chills by\n","night … what does it matter when you can fly? I would do it all again.\n","Jhiqui and Irri would be waiting atop her pyramid back in Meereen, she told herself.\n","Her sweet scribe Missandei as well, and all her little pages. They would bring her food,\n","and she could bathe in the pool beneath the persimmon tree. It would be good to feel clean\n","again. Dany did not need a glass to know that she was filthy.\n","She was hungry too. One morning she had found some wild onions growing halfway\n","down the south slope, and later that same day a leafy reddish vegetable that might have\n","been some queer sort of cabbage. Whatever it was, it had not made her sick. Aside from\n","that, and one fish that she had caught in the spring-fed pool outside of Drogon’s cave, she\n","had survived as best she could on the dragon’s leavings, on burned bones and chunks of\n","smoking meat, half-charred and half-raw. She needed more, she knew. One day she kicked\n","at a cracked sheep’s skull with the side of a bare foot and sent it bouncing over the edge of\n","the hill. And as she watched it tumble down the steep slope toward the sea of grass, she\n","realized she must follow.\n","Dany set off through the tall grass at a brisk pace. The earth felt warm between her toes.\n","The grass was as tall as she was. It never seemed so high when I was mounted on my\n","silver, riding beside my sun-and-stars at the head of his khalasar. As she walked, she\n","tapped her thigh with the pitmaster’s whip. That, and the rags on her back, were all she\n","had taken from Meereen.\n","Though she walked through a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer.\n","Even here autumn made its presence felt, and winter would not be far behind. The grass\n","was paler than she remembered, a wan and sickly green on the verge of going yellow.\n","After that would come brown. The grass was dying.\n","Daenerys Targaryen was no stranger to the Dothraki sea, the great ocean of grass that\n","stretched from the forest of Qohor to the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the\n","World. She had seen it first when she was still a girl, newly wed to Khal Drogo and on her\n","way to Vaes Dothrak to be presented to the crones of the dosh khaleen. The sight of all\n","that grass stretching out before her had taken her breath away. The sky was blue, the grass\n","was green, and I was full of hope. Ser Jorah had been with her then, her gruff old bear.\n","She’d had Irri and Jhiqui and Doreah to care for her, her sun-and-stars to hold her in the\n","night, his child growing inside her. Rhaego. I was going to name him Rhaego, and the\n","dosh khaleen said he would be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Not since those halfremembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door had she been\n","as happy.\n","But in the Red Waste, all her joy had turned to ashes. Her sun-and-stars had fallen from\n","his horse, the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had murdered Rhaego in her womb, and Dany had\n","smothered the empty shell of Khal Drogo with her own two hands. Afterward Drogo’s\n","great khalasar had shattered. Ko Pono named himself Khal Pono and took many riders\n","with him, and many slaves as well. Ko Jhaqo named himself Khal Jhaqo and rode off with\n","even more. Mago, his bloodrider, raped and murdered Eroeh, a girl Daenerys had once\n","saved from him. Only the birth of her dragons amidst the fire and smoke of Khal Drogo’s\n","funeral pyre had spared Dany herself from being dragged back to Vaes Dothrak to live out\n","the remainder of her days amongst the crones of the dosh khaleen.\n","The fire burned away my hair, but elsewise it did not touch me. It had been the same in\n","Daznak’s Pit. That much she could recall, though much of what followed was a haze. So\n","many people, screaming and shoving. She remembered rearing horses, a food cart spilling\n","melons as it overturned. From below a spear came flying, followed by a flight of crossbow\n","bolts. One passed so close that Dany felt it brush her cheek. Others skittered off Drogon’s\n","scales, lodged between them, or tore through the membrane of his wings. She remembered\n","the dragon twisting beneath her, shuddering at the impacts, as she tried desperately to\n","cling to his scaled back. The wounds were smoking. Dany saw one of the bolts burst into\n","sudden flame. Another fell away, shaken loose by the beating of his wings. Below, she\n","saw men whirling, wreathed in flame, hands up in the air as if caught in the throes of some\n","mad dance. A woman in a green tokar reached for a weeping child, pulling him down into\n","her arms to shield him from the flames. Dany saw the color vividly, but not the woman’s\n","face. People were stepping on her as they lay tangled on the bricks. Some were on fire.\n","Then all of that had faded, the sounds dwindling, the people shrinking, the spears and\n","arrows falling back beneath them as Drogon clawed his way into the sky. Up and up and\n","up he’d borne her, high above the pyramids and pits, his wings outstretched to catch the\n","warm air rising from the city’s sun baked bricks. If I fall and die, it will still have been\n","worth it, she had thought.\n","North they flew, beyond the river, Drogon gliding on torn and tattered wings through\n","clouds that whipped by like the banners of some ghostly army. Dany glimpsed the shores\n","of Slaver’s Bay and the old Valyrian road that ran beside it through sand and desolation\n","until it vanished in the west. The road home. Then there was nothing beneath them but\n","grass rippling in the wind.\n","Was that first flight a thousand years ago? Sometimes it seemed as if it must be.\n","The sun grew hotter as it rose, and before long her head was pounding. Dany’s hair was\n","growing out again, but slowly. “I need a hat,” she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had\n","tried to make one for herself, weaving stalks of grass together as she had seen Dothraki\n","women do during her time with Drogo, but either she was using the wrong sort of grass or\n","she simply lacked the necessary skill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. Try again,\n","she told herself. You will do better the next time. You are the blood of the dragon, you can\n","make a hat. She tried and tried, but her last attempt had been no more successful than her\n","first.\n","It was afternoon by the time Dany found the stream she had glimpsed atop the hill. It\n","was a rill, a rivulet, a trickle, no wider than her arm … and her arm had grown thinner\n","every day she spent on Dragonstone. Dany scooped up a handful of water and splashed it\n","on her face. When she cupped her hands, her knuckles squished in the mud at the bottom\n","of the stream. She might have wished for colder, clearer water … but no, if she were going\n","to pin her hopes on wishes, she would wish for rescue.\n","She still clung to the hope that someone would come after her. Ser Barristan might\n","come seeking her; he was the first of her Queensguard, sworn to defend her life with his\n","own. And her bloodriders were no strangers to the Dothraki sea, and their lives were\n","bound to her own. Her husband, the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq, might dispatch searchers.\n","And Daario … Dany pictured him riding toward her through the tall grass, smiling, his\n","golden tooth gleaming with the last light of the setting sun.\n","Only Daario had been given to the Yunkai’i, a hostage to ensure no harm came to the\n","Yunkish captains. Daario and Hero, Jhogo and Groleo, and three of Hizdahr’s kin. By\n","now, surely, all of her hostages would have been released. But …\n","She wondered if her captain’s blades still hung upon the wall beside her bed, waiting for\n","Daario to return and claim them. “I will leave my girls with you,” he had said. “Keep them\n","safe for me, beloved.” And she wondered how much the Yunkai’i knew about what her\n","captain meant to her. She had asked Ser Barristan that question the afternoon the hostages\n","went forth. “They will have heard the talk,” he had replied. “Naharis may even have\n","boasted of Your Grace’s … of your great … regard … for him. If you will forgive my\n","saying so, modesty is not one of the captain’s virtues. He takes great pride in his … his\n","swordsmanship.”\n","He boasts of bedding me, you mean. But Daario would not have been so foolish as to\n","make such a boast amongst her enemies. It makes no matter. By now the Yunkai’i will be\n","marching home. That was why she had done all that she had done. For peace.\n","She turned back the way she’d come, to where Dragonstone rose above the grasslands\n","like a clenched fist. It looks so close. I’ve been walking for hours, yet it still looks as if I\n","could reach out and touch it. It was not too late to go back. There were fish in the springfed pool by Drogon’s cave. She had caught one her first day there, she might catch more.\n","And there would be scraps, charred bones with bits of flesh still on them, the remnants of\n","Drogon’s kills.\n","No, Dany told herself. If I look back I am lost. She might live for years amongst the\n","sunbaked rocks of Dragonstone, riding Drogon by day and gnawing at his leavings every\n","evenfall as the great grass sea turned from gold to orange, but that was not the life she had\n","been born to. So once again she turned her back upon the distant hill and closed her ears to\n","the song of flight and freedom that the wind sang as it played amongst the hill’s stony\n","ridges. The stream was trickling south by southeast, as near as she could tell. She followed\n","it. Take me to the river, that is all I ask of you. Take me to the river, and I will do the rest.\n","The hours passed slowly. The stream bent this way and that, and Dany followed,\n","beating time upon her leg with the whip, trying not to think about how far she had to go,\n","or the pounding in her head, or her empty belly. Take one step. Take the next. Another step.\n","Another. What else could she do?\n","It was quiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed\n","against each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now and\n","again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. Mud squished\n","between her toes. Insects buzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps\n","and stinging midges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they\n","landed on her arms. Once she came upon a rat drinking from the stream, but it fled when\n","she appeared, scurrying between the stalks to vanish in the high grass. Sometimes she\n","heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them\n","with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and\n","now I’ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. “Men are mad and gods\n","are madder,” she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement.\n","Thrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have\n","been an eagle, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by\n","now, even when he was no more than a speck. The second time he passed before the sun,\n","his black wings spread, and the world darkened. The last time he flew right above her, so\n","close she could hear the sound of his wings. For half a heartbeat Dany thought that he was\n","hunting her, but he flew on without taking any notice of her and vanished somewhere in\n","the east. Just as well, she thought.\n","Evening took her almost unawares. As the sun was gilding the distant spires of\n","Dragonstone, Dany stumbled onto a low stone wall, overgrown and broken. Perhaps it had\n","been part of a temple, or the hall of the village lord. More ruins lay beyond it—an old\n","well, and some circles in the grass that marked the sites where hovels had once stood.\n","They had been built of mud and straw, she judged, but long years of wind and rain had\n","worn them away to nothing. Dany found eight before the sun went down, but there might\n","have been more farther out, hidden in the grass.\n","The stone wall had endured better than the rest. Though it was nowhere more than three\n","feet high, the angle where it met another, lower wall still offered some shelter from the\n","elements, and night was coming on fast. Dany wedged herself into that corner, making a\n","nest of sorts by tearing up handfuls of the grass that grew around the ruins. She was very\n","tired, and fresh blisters had appeared on both her feet, including a matched set upon her\n","pinky toes. It must be from the way I walk, she thought, giggling.\n","As the world darkened, Dany settled in and closed her eyes, but sleep refused to come.\n","The night was cold, the ground hard, her belly empty. She found herself thinking of\n","Meereen, of Daario, her love, and Hizdahr, her husband, of Irri and Jhiqui and sweet\n","Missandei, Ser Barristan and Reznak and Skahaz Shavepate. Do they fear me dead? I flew\n","off on a dragon’s back. Will they think he ate me? She wondered if Hizdahr was still king.\n","His crown had come from her, could he hold it in her absence? He wanted Drogon dead. I\n","heard him. “Kill it,” he screamed, “kill the beast,” and the look upon his face was lustful.\n","And Strong Belwas had been on his knees, heaving and shuddering. Poison. It had to be\n","poison. The honeyed locusts. Hizdahr urged them on me, but Belwas ate them all. She had\n","made Hizdahr her king, taken him into her bed, opened the fighting pits for him, he had no\n","reason to want her dead. Yet who else could it have been? Reznak, her perfumed\n","seneschal? The Yunkai’i? The Sons of the Harpy?\n","Off in the distance, a wolf howled. The sound made her feel sad and lonely, but no less\n","hungry. As the moon rose above the grasslands, Dany slipped at last into a restless sleep.\n","She dreamed. All her cares fell away from her, and all her pains as well, and she seemed\n","to float upward into the sky. She was flying once again, spinning, laughing, dancing, as\n","the stars wheeled around her and whispered secrets in her ear. “To go north, you must\n","journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward, you must go back. To\n","touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.”\n","“Quaithe?” Dany called. “Where are you, Quaithe?”\n","Then she saw. Her mask is made of starlight.\n","“Remember who you are, Daenerys,” the stars whispered in a woman’s voice. “The\n","dragons know. Do you?”\n","The next morning she woke stiff and sore and aching, with ants crawling on her arms\n","and legs and face. When she realized what they were, she kicked aside the stalks of dry\n","brown grass that had served as her bed and blanket and struggled to her feet. She had bites\n","all over her, little red bumps, itchy and inflamed. Where did all the ants come from? Dany\n","brushed them from her arms and legs and belly. She ran a hand across her stubbly scalp\n","where her hair had burned away, and felt more ants on her head, and one crawling down\n","the back of her neck. She knocked them off and crushed them under her bare feet. There\n","were so many …\n","It turned out that their anthill was on the other side of her wall. She wondered how the\n","ants had managed to climb over it and find her. To them these tumbledown stones must\n","loom as huge as the Wall of Westeros. The biggest wall in all the world, her brother\n","Viserys used to say, as proud as if he’d built it himself.\n","Viserys told her tales of knights so poor that they had to sleep beneath the ancient\n","hedges that grew along the byways of the Seven Kingdoms. Dany would have given much\n","and more for a nice thick hedge. Preferably one without an anthill.\n","The sun was only just coming up. A few bright stars lingered in the cobalt sky. Perhaps\n","one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his fiery stallion in the night lands and smiling down\n","on me. Dragonstone was still visible above the grasslands. It looks so close. I must be\n","leagues away by now, but it looks as if I could be back in an hour. She wanted to lie back\n","down, close her eyes, and give herself up to sleep. No. I must keep going. The stream. Just\n","follow the stream.\n","Dany took a moment to make certain of her directions. It would not do to walk the\n","wrong way and lose her stream. “My friend,” she said aloud. “If I stay close to my friend I\n","won’t get lost.” She would have slept beside the water if she dared, but there were animals\n","who came down to the stream to drink at night. She had seen their tracks. Dany would\n","make a poor meal for a wolf or lion, but even a poor meal was better than none.\n","Once she was certain which way was south, she counted off her paces. The stream\n","appeared at eight. Dany cupped her hands to drink. The water made her belly cramp, but\n","cramps were easier to bear than thirst. She had no other drink but the morning dew that\n","glistened on the tall grass, and no food at all unless she cared to eat the grass. I could try\n","eating ants. The little yellow ones were too small to provide much in the way of\n","nourishment, but there were red ants in the grass, and those were bigger. “I am lost at sea,”\n","she said as she limped along beside her meandering rivulet, “so perhaps I’ll find some\n","crabs, or a nice fat fish.” Her whip slapped softly against her thigh, wap wap wap. One\n","step at a time, and the stream would see her home.\n","Just past midday she came upon a bush growing by the stream, its twisted limbs\n","covered with hard green berries. Dany squinted at them suspiciously, then plucked one\n","from a branch and nibbled at it. Its flesh was tart and chewy, with a bitter aftertaste that\n","seemed familiar to her. “In the khalasar, they used berries like these to flavor roasts,” she\n","decided. Saying it aloud made her more certain of it. Her belly rumbled, and Dany found\n","herself picking berries with both hands and tossing them into her mouth.\n","An hour later, her stomach began to cramp so badly that she could not go on. She spent\n","the rest of that day retching up green slime. If I stay here, I will die. I may be dying now.\n","Would the horse god of the Dothraki part the grass and claim her for his starry khalasar,\n","so she might ride the nightlands with Khal Drogo? In Westeros the dead of House\n","Targaryen were given to the flames, but who would light her pyre here? My flesh will feed\n","the wolves and carrion crows, she thought sadly, and worms will burrow through my\n","womb. Her eyes went back to Dragonstone. It looked smaller. She could see smoke rising\n","from its wind-carved summit, miles away. Drogon has returned from hunting.\n","Sunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning. Every stool was looser than the one\n","before, and smelled fouler. By the time the moon came up she was shitting brown water.\n","The more she drank, the more she shat, but the more she shat, the thirstier she grew, and\n","her thirst sent her crawling to the stream to suck up more water. When she closed her eyes\n","at last, Dany did not know whether she would be strong enough to open them again.\n","She dreamt of her dead brother.\n","Viserys looked just as he had the last time she’d seen him. His mouth was twisted in\n","anguish, his hair was burnt, and his face was black and smoking where the molten gold\n","had run down across his brow and cheeks and into his eyes.\n","“You are dead,” Dany said.\n","Murdered. Though his lips never moved, somehow she could hear his voice, whispering\n","in her ear. You never mourned me, sister. It is hard to die unmourned.\n","“I loved you once.”\n","Once, he said, so bitterly it made her shudder. You were supposed to be my wife, to bear\n","me children with silver hair and purple eyes, to keep the blood of the dragon pure. I took\n","care of you. I taught you who you were. I fed you. I sold our mother’s crown to keep you\n","fed.\n","“You hurt me. You frightened me.”\n","Only when you woke the dragon. I loved you.\n","“You sold me. You betrayed me.”\n","No. You were the betrayer. You turned against me, against your own blood. They\n","cheated me. Your horsey husband and his stinking savages. They were cheats and liars.\n","They promised me a golden crown and gave me this. He touched the molten gold that was\n","creeping down his face, and smoke rose from his finger.\n","“You could have had your crown,” Dany told him. “My sun-and-stars would have won\n","it for you if only you had waited.”\n","I waited long enough. I waited my whole life. I was their king, their rightful king. They\n","laughed at me.\n","“You should have stayed in Pentos with Magister Illyrio. Khal Drogo had to present me\n","to the dosh khaleen, but you did not have to ride with us. That was your choice. Your\n","mistake.”\n","Do you want to wake the dragon, you stupid little whore? Drogo’s khalasar was mine. I\n","bought them from him, a hundred thousand screamers. I paid for them with your\n","maidenhead.\n","“You never understood. Dothraki do not buy and sell. They give gifts and receive them.\n","If you had waited …”\n","I did wait. For my crown, for my throne, for you. All those years, and all I ever got was\n","a pot of molten gold. Why did they give the dragon’s eggs to you? They should have been\n","mine. If I’d had a dragon, I would have taught the world the meaning of our words.\n","Viserys began to laugh, until his jaw fell away from his face, smoking, and blood and\n","molten gold ran from his mouth.\n","When she woke, gasping, her thighs were slick with blood.\n","For a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun to lighten, and\n","the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please, let me sleep some more. I’m so tired.\n","She tried to burrow back beneath the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep.\n","Some of the stalks felt wet. Had it rained again? She sat up, afraid that she had soiled\n","herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on\n","them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass,\n","and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood.\n","If she had not been so sick and scared, that might have come as a relief. Instead she\n","began to shiver violently. She rubbed her fingers through the dirt, and grabbed a handful\n","of grass to wipe between her legs. The dragon does not weep. She was bleeding, but it was\n","only woman’s blood. The moon is still a crescent, though. How can that be? She tried to\n","remember the last time she had bled. The last full moon? The one before? The one before\n","that? No, it cannot have been so long as that. “I am the blood of the dragon,” she told the\n","grass, aloud.\n","Once, the grass whispered back, until you chained your dragons in the dark.\n","“Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was … her name …” Dany could not recall the\n","child’s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been\n","burned away. “I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.”\n","Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children.\n","Her belly was empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping\n","had grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels. She scooped\n","up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid,\n","but in the chill of dawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she\n","splashed her face, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic\n","was stained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it’s only my\n","moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. Could it be the\n","water? If it was the water, she was doomed. She had to drink or die of thirst.\n","“Walk,” Dany commanded herself. “Follow the stream and it will take you to the\n","Skahazadhan. That’s where Daario will find you.” But it took all her strength just to get\n","back to her feet, and when she did all she could do was stand there, fevered and bleeding.\n","She raised her eyes to the empty blue sky, squinting at the sun. Half the morning gone\n","already, she realized, dismayed. She made herself take a step, and then another, and then\n","she was walking once again, following the little stream.\n","The day grew warmer, and the sun beat down upon her head and the burnt remnants of\n","her hair. Water splashed against the soles of her feet. She was walking in the stream. How\n","long had she been doing that? The soft brown mud felt good between her toes and helped\n","to soothe her blisters. In the stream or out of it, I must keep walking. Water flows downhill.\n","The stream will take me to the river, and the river will take me home.\n","Except it wouldn’t, not truly.\n","Meereen was not her home, and never would be. It was a city of strange men with\n","strange gods and stranger hair, of slavers wrapped in fringed tokars, where grace was\n","earned through whoring, butchery was art, and dog was a delicacy. Meereen would always\n","be the Harpy’s city, and Daenerys could not be a harpy.\n","Never, said the grass, in the gruff tones of Jorah Mormont. You were warned, Your\n","Grace. Let this city be, I said. Your war is in Westeros, I told you.\n","The voice was no more than a whisper, yet somehow Dany felt that he was walking just\n","behind her. My bear, she thought, my old sweet bear, who loved me and betrayed me. She\n","had missed him so. She wanted to see his ugly face, to wrap her arms around him and\n","press herself against his chest, but she knew that if she turned around Ser Jorah would be\n","gone. “I am dreaming,” she said. “A waking dream, a walking dream. I am alone and\n","lost.”\n","Lost, because you lingered, in a place that you were never meant to be, murmured Ser\n","Jorah, as softly as the wind. Alone, because you sent me from your side.\n","“You betrayed me. You informed on me, for gold.”\n","For home. Home was all I ever wanted.\n","“And me. You wanted me.” Dany had seen it in his eyes.\n","I did, the grass whispered, sadly.\n","“You kissed me. I never said you could, but you did. You sold me to my enemies, but\n","you meant it when you kissed me.”\n","I gave you good counsel. Save your spears and swords for the Seven Kingdoms, I told\n","you. Leave Meereen to the Meereenese and go west, I said. You would not listen.\n","“I had to take Meereen or see my children starve along the march.” Dany could still see\n","the trail of corpses she had left behind her crossing the Red Waste. It was not a sight she\n","wished to see again. “I had to take Meereen to feed my people.”\n","You took Meereen, he told her, yet still you lingered.\n","“To be a queen.”\n","You are a queen, her bear said. In Westeros.\n","“It is such a long way,” she complained. “I was tired, Jorah. I was weary of war. I\n","wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.”\n","No. You are the blood of the dragon. The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser\n","Jorah were falling farther behind. Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. Remember who\n","you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.\n","“Fire and Blood,” Daenerys told the swaying grass.\n","A stone turned under her foot. She stumbled to one knee and cried out in pain, hoping\n","against hope that her bear would gather her up and help her to her feet. When she turned\n","her head to look for him, all she saw was trickling brown water … and the grass, still\n","moving slightly. The wind, she told herself, the wind shakes the stalks and makes them\n","sway. Only no wind was blowing. The sun was overhead, the world still and hot. Midges\n","swarmed in the air, and a dragonfly floated over the stream, darting here and there. And\n","the grass was moving when it had no cause to move.\n","She fumbled in the water, found a stone the size of her fist, pulled it from the mud. It\n","was a poor weapon but better than an empty hand. From the corner of her eye Dany saw\n","the grass move again, off to her right. The grass swayed and bowed low, as if before a\n","king, but no king appeared to her. The world was green and empty. The world was green\n","and silent. The world was yellow, dying. I should get up, she told herself. I have to walk. I\n","have to follow the stream.\n","Through the grass came a soft silvery tinkling.\n","Bells, Dany thought, smiling, remembering Khal Drogo, her sun-and-stars, and the bells\n","he braided into his hair. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas\n","go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves, when my womb quickens again and I\n","bear a living child, Khal Drogo will return to me.\n","But none of those things had happened. Bells, Dany thought again. Her bloodriders had\n","found her. “Aggo,” she whispered. “Jhogo. Rakharo.” Might Daario have come with\n","them?\n","The green sea opened. A rider appeared. His braid was black and shiny, his skin as dark\n","as burnished copper, his eyes the shape of bitter almonds. Bells sang in his hair. He wore a\n","medallion belt and painted vest, with an arakh on one hip and a whip on the other. A\n","hunting bow and a quiver of arrows were slung from his saddle.\n","One rider, and alone. A scout. He was one who rode before the khalasar to find the\n","game and the good green grass, and sniff out foes wherever they might hide. If he found\n","her there, he would kill her, rape her, or enslave her. At best, he would send her back to the\n","crones of the dosh khaleen, where good khaleesi were supposed to go when their khals\n","had died.\n","He did not see her, though. The grass concealed her, and he was looking elsewhere.\n","Dany followed his eyes, and there the shadow flew, with wings spread wide. The dragon\n","was a mile off, and yet the scout stood frozen until his stallion began to whicker in fear.\n","Then he woke as if from a dream, wheeled his mount about, and raced off through the tall\n","grass at a gallop.\n","Dany watched him go. When the sound of his hooves had faded away to silence, she\n","began to shout. She called until her voice was hoarse … and Drogon came, snorting\n","plumes of smoke. The grass bowed down before him. Dany leapt onto his back. She stank\n","of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that mattered. “To go forward I must go back,”\n","she said. Her bare legs tightened around the dragon’s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon\n","threw himself into the sky. Her whip was gone, so she used her hands and feet and turned\n","him north by east, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he\n","smelled the rider’s fear.\n","In a dozen heartbeats they were past the Dothraki, as he galloped far below. To the right\n","and left, Dany glimpsed places where the grass was burned and ashen. Drogon has come\n","this way before, she realized. Like a chain of grey islands, the marks of his hunting dotted\n","the green grass sea.\n","A vast herd of horses appeared below them. There were riders too, a score or more, but\n","they turned and fled at the first sight of the dragon. The horses broke and ran when the\n","shadow fell upon them, racing through the grass until their sides were white with foam,\n","tearing the ground with their hooves … but as swift as they were, they could not fly. Soon\n","one horse began to lag behind the others. The dragon descended on him, roaring, and all at\n","once the poor beast was aflame, yet somehow he kept on running, screaming with every\n","step, until Drogon landed on him and broke his back. Dany clutched the dragon’s neck\n","with all her strength to keep from sliding off.\n","The carcass was too heavy for him to bear back to his lair, so Drogon consumed his kill\n","there, tearing at the charred flesh as the grasses burned around them, the air thick with\n","drifting smoke and the smell of burnt horsehair. Dany, starved, slid off his back and ate\n","with him, ripping chunks of smoking meat from the dead horse with bare, burned hands.\n","In Meereen I was a queen in silk, nibbling on stuffed dates and honeyed lamb, she\n","remembered. What would my noble husband think if he could see me now? Hizdahr would\n","be horrified, no doubt. But Daario …\n","Daario would laugh, carve off a hunk of horsemeat with his arakh, and squat down to\n","eat beside her.\n","As the western sky turned the color of a blood bruise, she heard the sound of\n","approaching horses. Dany rose, wiped her hands on her ragged undertunic, and went to\n","stand beside her dragon.\n","That was how Khal Jhaqo found her, when half a hundred mounted warriors emerged\n","from the drifting smoke.\n","\n","EPILOGUE\n","I am no traitor,” the Knight of Griffin’s Roost declared. “I am King Tommen’s man, and\n","yours.”\n","A steady drip-drip-drip punctuated his words, as snowmelt ran off his cloak to puddle\n","on the floor. The snow had been falling on King’s Landing most of the night; outside the\n","drifts were ankle deep. Ser Kevan Lannister pulled his cloak about himself more closely.\n","“So you say, ser. Words are wind.”\n","“Then let me prove the truth of them with my sword.” The light of the torches made a\n","fiery blaze of Ronnet Connington’s long red hair and beard. “Send me against my uncle,\n","and I will bring you back his head, and the head of this false dragon too.”\n","Lannister spearmen in crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms stood along the west\n","wall of the throne room. Tyrell guards in green cloaks faced them from the opposite wall.\n","The chill in the throne room was palpable. Though neither Queen Cersei nor Queen\n","Margaery was amongst them, their presence could be felt poisoning the air, like ghosts at a\n","feast.\n","Behind the table where the five members of the king’s small council were seated, the\n","Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast, its barbs and claws and blades halfshrouded in shadow. Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back, an itch between the\n","shoulder blades. It was easy to imagine old King Aerys perched up there, bleeding from\n","some fresh cut, glowering down. But today the throne was empty. He had seen no reason\n","for Tommen to join them. Kinder to let the boy remain with his mother. The Seven only\n","knew how long mother and son might have together before Cersei’s trial … and possibly\n","her execution.\n","Mace Tyrell was speaking. “We shall deal with your uncle and his feigned boy in due\n","time.” The new King’s Hand was seated on an oaken throne carved in the shape of a hand,\n","an absurd vanity his lordship had produced the day Ser Kevan agreed to grant him the\n","office he coveted. “You will bide here until we are ready to march. Then you shall have\n","the chance to prove your loyalty.”\n","Ser Kevan took no issue with that. “Escort Ser Ronnet back to his chambers,” he said.\n","And see that he remains there went unspoken. However loud his protestations, the Knight\n","of Griffin’s Roost remained suspect. Supposedly the sellswords who had landed in the\n","south were being led by one of his own blood.\n","As the echoes of Connington’s footsteps faded away, Grand Maester Pycelle gave a\n","ponderous shake of his head. “His uncle once stood just where the boy was standing now\n","and told King Aerys how he would deliver him the head of Robert Baratheon.”\n","That is how it is when a man grows as old as Pycelle. Everything you see or hear\n","reminds you of something you saw or heard when you were young. “How many men-at-\n","arms accompanied Ser Ronnet to the city?” Ser Kevan asked.\n","“Twenty,” said Lord Randyll Tarly, “and most of them Gregor Clegane’s old lot. Your\n","nephew Jaime gave them to Connington. To rid himself of them, I’d wager. They had not\n","been in Maidenpool a day before one killed a man and another was accused of rape. I had\n","to hang the one and geld the other. If it were up to me, I would send them all to the Night’s\n","Watch, and Connington with them. The Wall is where such scum belong.”\n","“A dog takes after its master,” declared Mace Tyrell. “Black cloaks would suit them, I\n","agree. I will not suffer such men in the city watch.” A hundred of his own Highgarden\n","men had been added to the gold cloaks, yet plainly his lordship meant to resist any\n","balancing infusion of westermen.\n","The more I give him, the more he wants. Kevan Lannister was beginning to understand\n","why Cersei had grown so resentful of the Tyrells. But this was not the moment to provoke\n","an open quarrel. Randyll Tarly and Mace Tyrell had both brought armies to King’s\n","Landing, whilst the best part of the strength of House Lannister remained in the riverlands,\n","fast melting away. “The Mountain’s men were always fighters,” he said in a conciliatory\n","tone, “and we may have need of every sword against these sellswords. If this truly is the\n","Golden Company, as Qyburn’s whisperers insist—”\n","“Call them what you will,” said Randyll Tarly. “They are still no more than\n","adventurers.”\n","“Perhaps,” Ser Kevan said. “But the longer we ignore these adventurers, the stronger\n","they grow. We have had a map prepared, a map of the incursions. Grand Maester?”\n","The map was beautiful, painted by a master’s hand on a sheet of the finest vellum, so\n","large it covered the table. “Here.” Pycelle pointed with a spotted hand. Where the sleeve\n","of his robe rode up, a flap of pale flesh could be seen dangling beneath his forearm. “Here\n","and here. All along the coast, and on the islands. Tarth, the Stepstones, even Estermont.\n","And now we have reports that Connington is moving on Storm’s End.”\n","“If it is Jon Connington,” said Randyll Tarly.\n","“Storm’s End.” Lord Mace Tyrell grunted the words. “He cannot take Storm’s End. Not\n","if he were Aegon the Conqueror. And if he does, what of it? Stannis holds it now. Let the\n","castle pass from one pretender to another, why should that trouble us? I shall recapture it\n","after my daughter’s innocence is proved.”\n","How can you recapture it when you have never captured it to begin with? “I understand,\n","my lord, but—”\n","Tyrell did not let him finish. “These charges against my daughter are filthy lies. I ask\n","again, why must we play out this mummer’s farce? Have King Tommen declare my\n","daughter innocent, ser, and put an end to the foolishness here and now.”\n","Do that, and the whispers will follow Margaery the rest of her life. “No man doubts\n","your daughter’s innocence, my lord,” Ser Kevan lied, “but His High Holiness insists upon\n","a trial.”\n","Lord Randyll snorted. “What have we become, when kings and high lords must dance\n","to the twittering of sparrows?”\n","“We have foes on every hand, Lord Tarly,” Ser Kevan reminded him. “Stannis in the\n","north, ironmen in the west, sellswords in the south. Defy the High Septon, and we will\n","have blood running in the gutters of King’s Landing as well. If we are seen to be going\n","against the gods, it will only drive the pious into the arms of one or the other of these\n","would-be usurpers.”\n","Mace Tyrell remained unmoved. “Once Paxter Redwyne sweeps the ironmen from the\n","seas, my sons will retake the Shields. The snows will do for Stannis, or Bolton will. As for\n","Connington …”\n","“If it is him,” Lord Randyll said.\n","“… as for Connington,” Tyrell repeated, “what victories has he ever won that we should\n","fear him? He could have ended Robert’s Rebellion at Stoney Sept. He failed. Just as the\n","Golden Company has always failed. Some may rush to join them, aye. The realm is well\n","rid of such fools.”\n","Ser Kevan wished that he could share his certainty. He had known Jon Connington,\n","slightly—a proud youth, the most headstrong of the gaggle of young lordlings who had\n","gathered around Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, competing for his royal favor. Arrogant, but\n","able and energetic. That, and his skill at arms, was why Mad King Aerys had named him\n","Hand. Old Lord Merryweather’s inaction had allowed the rebellion to take root and\n","spread, and Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert’s own youth and\n","vigor. “Too soon,” Lord Tywin Lannister had declared when word of the king’s choice had\n","reached Casterly Rock. “Connington is too young, too bold, too eager for glory.”\n","The Battle of the Bells had proved the truth of that. Ser Kevan had expected that\n","afterward Aerys would have no choice but to summon Tywin once more … but the Mad\n","King had turned to the Lords Chelsted and Rossart instead, and paid for it with life and\n","crown. That was all so long ago, though. If this is indeed Jon Connington, he will be a\n","different man. Older, harder, more seasoned … more dangerous. “Connington may have\n","more than the Golden Company. It is said he has a Targaryen pretender.”\n","“A feigned boy is what he has,” said Randyll Tarly.\n","“That may be. Or not.” Kevan Lannister had been here, in this very hall when Tywin\n","had laid the bodies of Prince Rhaegar’s children at the foot of the Iron Throne, wrapped up\n","in crimson cloaks. The girl had been recognizably the Princess Rhaenys, but the boy … a\n","faceless horror of bone and brain and gore, a few hanks of fair hair. None of us looked\n","long. Tywin said that it was Prince Aegon, and we took him at his word. “We have these\n","tales coming from the east as well. A second Targaryen, and one whose blood no man can\n","question. Daenerys Stormborn.”\n","“As mad as her father,” declared Lord Mace Tyrell.\n","That would be the same father that Highgarden and House Tyrell supported to the bitter\n","end and well beyond. “Mad she may be,” Ser Kevan said, “but with so much smoke\n","drifting west, surely there must be some fire burning in the east.”\n","Grand Maester Pycelle bobbed his head. “Dragons. These same stories have reached\n","Oldtown. Too many to discount. A silver-haired queen with three dragons.”\n","“At the far end of the world,” said Mace Tyrell. “Queen of Slaver’s Bay, aye. She is\n","welcome to it.”\n","“On that we can agree,” Ser Kevan said, “but the girl is of the blood of Aegon the\n","Conqueror, and I do not think she will be content to remain in Meereen forever. If she\n","should reach these shores and join her strength to Lord Connington and this prince of his,\n","feigned or no … we must destroy Connington and his pretender now, before Daenerys\n","Stormborn can come west.”\n","Mace Tyrell crossed his arms. “I mean to do just that, ser. After the trials.”\n","“Sellswords fight for coin,” declared Grand Maester Pycelle. “With enough gold, we\n","might persuade the Golden Company to hand over Lord Connington and the pretender.”\n","“Aye, if we had gold,” Ser Harys Swyft said. “Alas, my lords, our vaults contain only\n","rats and roaches. I have written again to the Myrish bankers. If they will agree to make\n","good the crown’s debt to the Braavosi and extend us a new loan, mayhaps we will not\n","have to raise the taxes. Elsewise—”\n","“The magisters of Pentos have been known to lend money as well,” said Ser Kevan.\n","“Try them.” The Pentoshi were even less like to be of help than the Myrish money\n","changers, but the effort must be made. Unless a new source of coin could be found, or the\n","Iron Bank persuaded to relent, he would have no choice but to pay the crown’s debts with\n","Lannister gold. He dare not resort to new taxes, not with the Seven Kingdoms crawling\n","with rebellion. Half the lords in the realm could not tell taxation from tyranny, and would\n","bolt to the nearest usurper in a heartbeat if it would save them a clipped copper. “If that\n","fails, you may well need to go to Braavos, to treat with the Iron Bank yourself.”\n","Ser Harys quailed. “Must I?”\n","“You are the master of coin,” Lord Randyll said sharply.\n","“I am.” The puff of white hair at the end of Swyft’s chin quivered in outrage. “Must I\n","remind my lord, this trouble is not of my doing? And not all of us have had the\n","opportunity to refill our coffers with the plunder of Maidenpool and Dragonstone.”\n","“I resent your implication, Swyft,” Mace Tyrell said, bristling. “No wealth was found\n","on Dragonstone, I promise you. My son’s men have searched every inch of that damp and\n","dreary island and turned up not so much as a single gemstone or speck of gold. Nor any\n","sign of this fabled hoard of dragon eggs.”\n","Kevan Lannister had seen Dragonstone with his own eyes. He doubted very much that\n","Loras Tyrell had searched every inch of that ancient stronghold. The Valyrians had raised\n","it, after all, and all their works stank of sorcery. And Ser Loras was young, prone to all the\n","rash judgments of youth, and had been grievously wounded storming the castle besides.\n","But it would not do to remind Tyrell that his favorite son was fallible. “If there was wealth\n","on Dragonstone, Stannis would have found it,” he declared. “Let us move along, my lords.\n","We have two queens to try for high treason, you may recall. My niece has elected trial by\n","battle, she informs me. Ser Robert Strong will champion her.”\n","“The silent giant.” Lord Randyll grimaced.\n","“Tell me, ser, where did this man come from?” demanded Mace Tyrell. “Why have we\n","never heard his name before? He does not speak, he will not show his face, he is never\n","seen without his armor. Do we know for a certainty that he is even a knight?”\n","We do not even know if he’s alive. Meryn Trant claimed that Strong took neither food\n","nor drink, and Boros Blount went so far as to say he had never seen the man use the privy.\n","Why should he? Dead men do not shit. Kevan Lannister had a strong suspicion of just who\n","this Ser Robert really was beneath that gleaming white armor. A suspicion that Mace\n","Tyrell and Randyll Tarly no doubt shared. Whatever the face hidden behind Strong’s helm,\n","it must remain hidden for now. The silent giant was his niece’s only hope. And pray that\n","he is as formidable as he appears.\n","But Mace Tyrell could not seem to see beyond the threat to his own daughter. “His\n","Grace named Ser Robert to the Kingsguard,” Ser Kevan reminded him, “and Qyburn\n","vouches for the man as well. Be that as it may, we need Ser Robert to prevail, my lords. If\n","my niece is proved guilty of these treasons, the legitimacy of her children will be called\n","into question. If Tommen ceases to be a king, Margaery will cease to be a queen.” He let\n","Tyrell chew on that a moment. “Whatever Cersei may have done, she is still a daughter of\n","the Rock, of mine own blood. I will not let her die a traitor’s death, but I have made sure\n","to draw her fangs. All her guards have been dismissed and replaced with my own men. In\n","place of her former ladies-in-waiting, she will henceforth be attended by a septa and three\n","novices selected by the High Septon. She is to have no further voice in the governance of\n","the realm, nor in Tommen’s education. I mean to return her to Casterly Rock after the trial\n","and see that she remains there. Let that suffice.”\n","The rest he left unsaid. Cersei was soiled goods now, her power at an end. Every\n","baker’s boy and beggar in the city had seen her in her shame and every tart and tanner\n","from Flea Bottom to Pisswater Bend had gazed upon her nakedness, their eager eyes\n","crawling over her breasts and belly and woman’s parts. No queen could expect to rule\n","again after that. In gold and silk and emeralds Cersei had been a queen, the next thing to a\n","goddess; naked, she was only human, an aging woman with stretch marks on her belly and\n","teats that had begun to sag … as the shrews in the crowds had been glad to point out to\n","their husbands and lovers. Better to live shamed than die proud, Ser Kevan told himself.\n","“My niece will make no further mischief,” he promised Mace Tyrell. “You have my word\n","on that, my lord.”\n","Tyrell gave a grudging nod. “As you say. My Margaery prefers to be tried by the Faith,\n","so the whole realm can bear witness to her innocence.”\n","If your daughter is as innocent as you’d have us believe, why must you have your army\n","present when she faces her accusers? Ser Kevan might have asked. “Soon, I hope,” he\n","said instead, before turning to Grand Maester Pycelle. “Is there aught else?”\n","The Grand Maester consulted his papers. “We should address the Rosby inheritance. Six\n","claims have been put forth—”\n","“We can settle Rosby at some later date. What else?”\n","“Preparations should be made for Princess Myrcella.”\n","“This is what comes of dealing with the Dornish,” Mace Tyrell said. “Surely a better\n","match can be found for the girl?”\n","Such as your own son Willas, perhaps? Her disfigured by one Dornishman, him\n","crippled by another? “No doubt,” Ser Kevan said, “but we have enemies enough without\n","offending Dorne. If Doran Martell were to join his strength to Connington’s in support of\n","this feigned dragon, things could go very ill for all of us.”\n","“Mayhaps we can persuade our Dornish friends to deal with Lord Connington,” Ser\n","Harys Swyft said with an irritating titter. “That would save a deal of blood and trouble.”\n","“It would,” Ser Kevan said wearily. Time to put an end to this. “Thank you, my lords.\n","Let us convene again five days hence. After Cersei’s trial.”\n","“As you say. May the Warrior lend strength to Ser Robert’s arms.” The words were\n","grudging, the dip of the chin Mace Tyrell gave the Lord Regent the most cursory of bows.\n","But it was something, and for that much Ser Kevan Lannister was grateful.\n","Randyll Tarly left the hall with his liege lord, their green-cloaked spearmen right behind\n","them. Tarly is the real danger, Ser Kevan reflected as he watched their departure. A\n","narrow man, but iron-willed and shrewd, and as good a soldier as the Reach could boast.\n","But how do I win him to our side?\n","“Lord Tyrell loves me not,” Grand Maester Pycelle said in gloomy tones when the Hand\n","had departed. “This matter of the moon tea … I would never have spoken of such, but the\n","Queen Dowager commanded me! If it please the Lord Regent, I would sleep more soundly\n","if you could lend me some of your guards.”\n","“Lord Tyrell might take that amiss.”\n","Ser Harys Swyft tugged at his chin beard. “I am in need of guards myself. These are\n","perilous times.”\n","Aye, thought Kevan Lannister, and Pycelle is not the only council member our Hand\n","would like to replace. Mace Tyrell had his own candidate for lord treasurer: his uncle,\n","Lord Seneschal of Highgarden, whom men called Garth the Gross. The last thing I need is\n","another Tyrell on the small council. He was already outnumbered. Ser Harys was his\n","wife’s father, and Pycelle could be counted upon as well. But Tarly was sworn to\n","Highgarden, as was Paxter Redwyne, lord admiral and master of ships, presently sailing\n","his fleet around Dorne to deal with Euron Greyjoy’s ironmen. Once Redwyne returned to\n","King’s Landing, the council would stand at three and three, Lannister and Tyrell.\n","The seventh voice would be the Dornishwoman now escorting Myrcella home. The\n","Lady Nym. But no lady, if even half of what Qyburn reports is true. A bastard daughter of\n","the Red Viper, near as notorious as her father and intent on claiming the council seat that\n","Prince Oberyn himself had occupied so briefly. Ser Kevan had not yet seen fit to inform\n","Mace Tyrell of her coming. The Hand, he knew, would not be pleased. The man we need is\n","Littlefinger. Petyr Baelish had a gift for conjuring dragons from the air.\n","“Hire the Mountain’s men,” Ser Kevan suggested. “Red Ronnet will have no further use\n","for them.” He did not think that Mace Tyrell would be so clumsy as to try to murder either\n","Pycelle or Swyft, but if guards made them feel safer, let them have guards.\n","The three men walked together from the throne room. Outside the snow was swirling\n","round the outer ward, a caged beast howling to be free. “Have you ever felt such cold?”\n","asked Ser Harys.\n","“The time to speak of the cold,” said Grand Maester Pycelle, “is not when we are\n","standing out in it.” He made his slow way across the outer ward, back to his chambers.\n","The others lingered for a moment on the throne room steps. “I put no faith in these\n","Myrish bankers,” Ser Kevan told his good-father. “You had best prepare to go to\n","Braavos.”\n","Ser Harys did not look happy at the prospect. “If I must. But I say again, this trouble is\n","not of my doing.”\n","“No. It was Cersei who decided that the Iron Bank would wait for their due. Should I\n","send her to Braavos?”\n","Ser Harys blinked. “Her Grace … that … that …”\n","Ser Kevan rescued him. “That was a jape. A bad one. Go and find a warm fire. I mean\n","to do the same.” He yanked his gloves on and set off across the yard, leaning hard into the\n","wind as his cloak snapped and swirled behind him.\n","The dry moat surrounding Maegor’s Holdfast was three feet deep in snow, the iron\n","spikes that lined it glistening with frost. The only way in or out of Maegor’s was across\n","the drawbridge that spanned that moat. A knight of the Kingsguard was always posted at\n","its far end. Tonight the duty had fallen to Ser Meryn Trant. With Balon Swann hunting the\n","rogue knight Darkstar down in Dorne, Loras Tyrell gravely wounded on Dragonstone, and\n","Jaime vanished in the riverlands, only four of the White Swords remained in King’s\n","Landing, and Ser Kevan had thrown Osmund Kettleblack (and his brother Osfryd) into the\n","dungeon within hours of Cersei’s confessing that she had taken both men as lovers. That\n","left only Trant, the feeble Boros Blount, and Qyburn’s mute monster Robert Strong to\n","protect the young king and royal family.\n","I will need to find some new swords for the Kingsguard. Tommen should have seven\n","good knights about him. In the past the Kingsguard had served for life, but that had not\n","stopped Joffrey from dismissing Ser Barristan Selmy to make a place for his dog, Sandor\n","Clegane. Kevan could make use of that precedent. I could put Lancel in a white cloak, he\n","reflected. There is more honor in that than he will ever find in the Warrior’s Sons.\n","Kevan Lannister hung his snow-sodden cloak inside his solar, pulled off his boots, and\n","commanded his serving man to fetch some fresh wood for his fire. “A cup of mulled wine\n","would go down well,” he said as he settled by the hearth. “See to it.”\n","The fire soon thawed him, and the wine warmed his insides nicely. It also made him\n","sleepy, so he dare not drink another cup. His day was far from done. He had reports to\n","read, letters to write. And supper with Cersei and the king. His niece had been subdued\n","and submissive since her walk of atonement, thank the gods. The novices who attended\n","her reported that she spent a third of her waking hours with her son, another third in\n","prayer, and the rest in her tub. She was bathing four or five times a day, scrubbing herself\n","with horsehair brushes and strong lye soap, as if she meant to scrape her skin off.\n","She will never wash the stain away, no matter how hard she scrubs. Ser Kevan\n","remembered the girl she once had been, so full of life and mischief. And when she’d\n","flowered, ahhhh … had there ever been a maid so sweet to look upon? If Aerys had agreed\n","to marry her to Rhaegar, how many deaths might have been avoided? Cersei could have\n","given the prince the sons he wanted, lions with purple eyes and silver manes … and with\n","such a wife, Rhaegar might never have looked twice at Lyanna Stark. The northern girl\n","had a wild beauty, as he recalled, though however bright a torch might burn it could never\n","match the rising sun.\n","But it did no good to brood on lost battles and roads not taken. That was a vice of old\n","done men. Rhaegar had wed Elia of Dorne, Lyanna Stark had died, Robert Baratheon had\n","taken Cersei to bride, and here they were. And tonight his own road would take him to his\n","niece’s chambers and face-to-face with Cersei.\n","I have no reason to feel guilty, Ser Kevan told himself. Tywin would understand that,\n","surely. It was his daughter who brought shame down on our name, not I. What I did I did\n","for the good of House Lannister.\n","It was not as if his brother had never done the same. In their father’s final years, after\n","their mother’s passing, their sire had taken the comely daughter of a candlemaker as\n","mistress. It was not unknown for a widowed lord to keep a common girl as\n","bedwarmer … but Lord Tytos soon began seating the woman beside him in the hall,\n","showering her with gifts and honors, even asking her views on matters of state. Within a\n","year she was dismissing servants, ordering about his household knights, even speaking for\n","his lordship when he was indisposed. She grew so influential that it was said about\n","Lannisport that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her\n","and speak loudly to her lap … for Tytos Lannister’s ear was between his lady’s legs. She\n","had even taken to wearing their mother’s jewels.\n","Until the day their lord father’s heart had burst in his chest as he was ascending a steep\n","flight of steps to her bed, that is. All the self-seekers who had named themselves her\n","friends and cultivated her favor had abandoned her quickly enough when Tywin had her\n","stripped naked and paraded through Lannisport to the docks, like a common whore.\n","Though no man laid a hand on her, that walk spelled the end of her power. Surely Tywin\n","would never have dreamed that same fate awaited his own golden daughter.\n","“It had to be,” Ser Kevan muttered over the last of his wine. His High Holiness had to\n","be appeased. Tommen needed the Faith behind him in the battles to come. And\n","Cersei … the golden child had grown into a vain, foolish, greedy woman. Left to rule, she\n","would have ruined Tommen as she had Joffrey.\n","Outside the wind was rising, clawing at the shutters of his chamber. Ser Kevan pushed\n","himself to his feet. Time to face the lioness in her den. We have pulled her claws. Jaime,\n","though … But no, he would not brood on that.\n","He donned an old, well-worn doublet, in case his niece had a mind to throw another cup\n","of wine in his face, but he left his sword belt hanging on the back of his chair. Only the\n","knights of the Kingsguard were permitted swords in Tommen’s presence.\n","Ser Boros Blount was in attendance on the boy king and his mother when Ser Kevan\n","entered the royal chambers. Blount wore enameled scale, white cloak, and halfhelm. He\n","did not look well. Of late Boros had grown notably heavier about the face and belly, and\n","his color was not good. And he was leaning against the wall behind him, as if standing had\n","become too great an effort for him.\n","The meal was served by three novices, well-scrubbed girls of good birth between the\n","ages of twelve and sixteen. In their soft white woolens, each seemed more innocent and\n","unworldly than the last, yet the High Septon had insisted that no girl spend more than\n","seven days in the queen’s service, lest Cersei corrupt her. They tended the queen’s\n","wardrobe, drew her bath, poured her wine, changed her bedclothes of a morning. One\n","shared the queen’s bed every night, to ascertain she had no other company; the other two\n","slept in an adjoining chamber with the septa who looked over them.\n","A tall stork of a girl with a pockmarked face escorted him into the royal presence.\n","Cersei rose when he entered and kissed him lightly on the cheek. “Dear uncle. It is so\n","good of you to sup with us.” The queen was dressed as modestly as any matron, in a dark\n","brown gown that buttoned up to her throat and a hooded green mantle that covered her\n","shaved head. Before her walk she would have flaunted her baldness beneath a golden\n","crown. “Come, sit,” she said. “Will you have wine?”\n","“A cup.” He sat, still wary.\n","A freckled novice filled their cups with hot spiced wine. “Tommen tells me that Lord\n","Tyrell intends to rebuild the Tower of the Hand,” Cersei said.\n","Ser Kevan nodded. “The new tower will be twice as tall as the one you burned, he\n","says.”\n","Cersei gave a throaty laugh. “Long lances, tall towers … is Lord Tyrell hinting at\n","something?”\n","That made him smile. It is good that she still remembers how to laugh. When he asked\n","if she had all that she required, the queen said, “I am well served. The girls are sweet, and\n","the good septas make certain that I say my prayers. But once my innocence is proved, it\n","would please me if Taena Merryweather might attend me once again. She could bring her\n","son to court. Tommen needs other boys about him, friends of noble birth.”\n","It was a modest request. Ser Kevan saw no reason why it should not be granted. He\n","could foster the Merryweather boy himself, whilst Lady Taena accompanied Cersei back\n","to Casterly Rock. “I will send for her after the trial,” he promised.\n","Supper began with beef-and-barley soup, followed by a brace of quail and a roast pike\n","near three feet long, with turnips, mushrooms, and plenty of hot bread and butter. Ser\n","Boros tasted every dish that was set before the king. A humiliating duty for a knight of the\n","Kingsguard, but perhaps all Blount was capable of these days … and wise, after the way\n","Tommen’s brother had died.\n","The king seemed happier than Kevan Lannister had seen him in a long time. From soup\n","to sweet Tommen burbled about the exploits of his kittens, whilst feeding them morsels of\n","pike off his own royal plate. “The bad cat was outside my window last night,” he informed\n","Kevan at one point, “but Ser Pounce hissed at him and he ran off across the roofs.”\n","“The bad cat?” Ser Kevan said, amused. He is a sweet boy.\n","“An old black tomcat with a torn ear,” Cersei told him. “A filthy thing, and foultempered. He clawed Joff’s hand once.” She made a face. “The cats keep the rats down, I\n","know, but that one … he’s been known to attack ravens in the rookery.”\n","“I will ask the ratters to set a trap for him.” Ser Kevan could not remember ever seeing\n","his niece so quiet, so subdued, so demure. All for the good, he supposed. But it made him\n","sad as well. Her fire is quenched, she who used to burn so bright. “You have not asked\n","about your brother,” he said, as they were waiting for the cream cakes. Cream cakes were\n","the king’s favorite.\n","Cersei lifted her chin, her green eyes shining in the candlelight. “Jaime? Have you had\n","word?”\n","“None. Cersei, you may need to prepare yourself for—”\n","“If he were dead, I would know it. We came into this world together, Uncle. He would\n","not go without me.” She took a drink of wine. “Tyrion can leave whenever he wishes. You\n","have had no word of him either, I suppose.”\n","“No one has tried to sell us a dwarf’s head of late, no.”\n","She nodded. “Uncle, may I ask you a question?”\n","“Whatever you wish.”\n","“Your wife … do you mean to bring her to court?”\n","“No.” Dorna was a gentle soul, never comfortable but at home with friends and kin\n","around her. She had done well by their children, dreamed of having grandchildren, prayed\n","seven times a day, loved needlework and flowers. In King’s Landing she would be as\n","happy as one of Tommen’s kittens in a pit of vipers. “My lady wife mislikes travel.\n","Lannisport is her place.”\n","“It is a wise woman who knows her place.”\n","He did not like the sound of that. “Say what you mean.”\n","“I thought I did.” Cersei held out her cup. The freckled girl filled it once again. The\n","cream cakes appeared then, and the conversation took a lighter turn. Only after Tommen\n","and his kittens were escorted off to the royal bedchamber by Ser Boros did their talk turn\n","to the queen’s trial.\n","“Osney’s brothers will not stand by idly and watch him die,” Cersei warned him.\n","“I did not expect that they would. I’ve had the both of them arrested.”\n","That seemed to take her aback. “For what crime?”\n","“Fornication with a queen. His High Holiness says that you confessed to bedding both\n","of them—had you forgotten?”\n","Her face reddened. “No. What will you do with them?”\n","“The Wall, if they admit their guilt. If they deny it, they can face Ser Robert. Such men\n","should never have been raised so high.”\n","Cersei lowered her head. “I … I misjudged them.”\n","“You misjudged a good many men, it seems.”\n","He might have said more, but the dark-haired novice with the round cheeks returned to\n","say, “My lord, my lady, I am sorry to intrude, but there is a boy below. Grand Maester\n","Pycelle begs the favor of the Lord Regent’s presence at once.”\n","Dark wings, dark words, Ser Kevan thought. Could Storm’s End have fallen? Or might\n","this be word from Bolton in the north?\n","“It might be news of Jaime,” the queen said.\n","There was only one way to know. Ser Kevan rose. “Pray excuse me.” Before he took his\n","leave, he dropped to one knee and kissed his niece upon the hand. If her silent giant failed\n","her, it might be the last kiss she would ever know.\n","The messenger was a boy of eight or nine, so bundled up in fur he seemed a bear cub.\n","Trant had kept him waiting out on the drawbridge rather than admit him into Maegor’s.\n","“Go find a fire, lad,” Ser Kevan told him, pressing a penny into his hand. “I know the way\n","to the rookery well enough.”\n","The snow had finally stopped falling. Behind a veil of ragged clouds, a full moon\n","floated fat and white as a snowball. The stars shone cold and distant. As Ser Kevan made\n","his way across the inner ward, the castle seemed an alien place, where every keep and\n","tower had grown icy teeth, and all familiar paths had vanished beneath a white blanket.\n","Once an icicle long as a spear fell to shatter by his feet. Autumn in King’s Landing, he\n","brooded. What must it be like up on the Wall?\n","The door was opened by a serving girl, a skinny thing in a fur-lined robe much too big\n","for her. Ser Kevan stamped the snow off his boots, removed his cloak, tossed it to her.\n","“The Grand Maester is expecting me,” he announced. The girl nodded, solemn and silent,\n","and pointed to the steps.\n","Pycelle’s chambers were beneath the rookery, a spacious suite of rooms cluttered with\n","racks of herbs and salves and potions and shelves jammed full of books and scrolls. Ser\n","Kevan had always found them uncomfortably hot. Not tonight. Once past the chamber\n","door, the chill was palpable. Black ash and dying embers were all that remained of the\n","hearthfire. A few flickering candles cast pools of dim light here and there.\n","The rest was shrouded in shadow … except beneath the open window, where a spray of\n","ice crystals glittered in the moonlight, swirling in the wind. On the window seat a raven\n","loitered, pale, huge, its feathers ruffled. It was the largest raven that Kevan Lannister had\n","ever seen. Larger than any hunting hawk at Casterly Rock, larger than the largest owl.\n","Blowing snow danced around it, and the moon painted it silver.\n","Not silver. White. The bird is white.\n","The white ravens of the Citadel did not carry messages, as their dark cousins did. When\n","they went forth from Oldtown, it was for one purpose only: to herald a change of seasons.\n","“Winter,” said Ser Kevan. The word made a white mist in the air. He turned away from\n","the window.\n","Then something slammed him in the chest between the ribs, hard as a giant’s fist. It\n","drove the breath from him and sent him lurching backwards. The white raven took to the\n","air, its pale wings slapping him about the head. Ser Kevan half-sat and half-fell onto the\n","window seat. What … who … A quarrel was sunk almost to the fletching in his chest. No.\n","No, that was how my brother died. Blood was seeping out around the shaft. “Pycelle,” he\n","muttered, confused. “Help me … I …”\n","Then he saw. Grand Maester Pycelle was seated at his table, his head pillowed on the\n","great leather-bound tome before him. Sleeping, Kevan thought … until he blinked and saw\n","the deep red gash in the old man’s spotted skull and the blood pooled beneath his head,\n","staining the pages of his book. All around his candle were bits of bone and brain, islands\n","in a lake of melted wax.\n","He wanted guards, Ser Kevan thought. I should have sent him guards. Could Cersei\n","have been right all along? Was this his nephew’s work? “Tyrion?” he called. “Where …?”\n","“Far away,” a half-familiar voice replied.\n","He stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase, plump, pale-faced, round-shouldered,\n","clutching a crossbow in soft powdered hands. Silk slippers swaddled his feet.\n","“Varys?”\n","The eunuch set the crossbow down. “Ser Kevan. Forgive me if you can. I bear you no\n","ill will. This was not done from malice. It was for the realm. For the children.”\n","I have children. I have a wife. Oh, Dorna. Pain washed over him. He closed his eyes,\n","opened them again. “There are … there are hundreds of Lannister guardsmen in this\n","castle.”\n","“But none in this room, thankfully. This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die\n","alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad\n","causes … but you were threatening to undo all the queen’s good work, to reconcile\n","Highgarden and Casterly Rock, bind the Faith to your little king, unite the Seven\n","Kingdoms under Tommen’s rule. So …”\n","A gust of wind blew up. Ser Kevan shivered violently.\n","“Are you cold, my lord?” asked Varys. “Do forgive me. The Grand Maester befouled\n","himself in dying, and the stink was so abominable that I thought I might choke.”\n","Ser Kevan tried to rise, but the strength had left him. He could not feel his legs.\n","“I thought the crossbow fitting. You shared so much with Lord Tywin, why not that?\n","Your niece will think the Tyrells had you murdered, mayhaps with the connivance of the\n","Imp. The Tyrells will suspect her. Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the\n","Dornishmen. Doubt, division, and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king,\n","whilst Aegon raises his banner above Storm’s End and the lords of the realm gather round\n","him.”\n","“Aegon?” For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A babe swaddled\n","in a crimson cloak, the cloth stained with his blood and brains. “Dead. He’s dead.”\n","“No.” The eunuch’s voice seemed deeper. “He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule\n","since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that\n","was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has\n","studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith\n","since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his\n","hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He\n","can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be\n","hunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that\n","kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.”\n","Kevan Lannister tried to cry out … to his guards, his wife, his brother … but the words\n","would not come. Blood dribbled from his mouth. He shuddered violently.\n","“I am sorry.” Varys wrung his hands. “You are suffering, I know, yet here I stand going\n","on like some silly old woman. Time to make an end to it.” The eunuch pursed his lips and\n","gave a little whistle.\n","Ser Kevan was cold as ice, and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through\n","him. He glimpsed movement, heard the soft scuffling sound of slippered feet on stone. A\n","child emerged from a pool of darkness, a pale boy in a ragged robe, no more than nine or\n","ten. Another rose up behind the Grand Maester’s chair. The girl who had opened the door\n","for him was there as well. They were all around him, half a dozen of them, white-faced\n","children with dark eyes, boys and girls together.\n","And in their hands, the daggers.''',\n","'''The hill was a stony island in a sea of green.\n","It took Dany half the morning to climb down. By the time she reached the bottom she\n","was winded. Her muscles ached, and she felt as if she had the beginnings of a fever. The\n","rocks had scraped her hands raw. They are better than they were, though, she decided as\n","she picked at a broken blister. Her skin was pink and tender, and a pale milky fluid was\n","leaking from her cracked palms, but her burns were healing.\n","The hill loomed larger down here. Dany had taken to calling it Dragonstone, after the\n","ancient citadel where she’d been born. She had no memories of that Dragonstone, but she\n","would not soon forget this one. Scrub grass and thorny bushes covered its lower slopes;\n","higher up a jagged tangle of bare rock thrust steep and sudden into the sky. There, amidst\n","broken boulders, razor-sharp ridges, and needle spires, Drogon made his lair inside a\n","shallow cave. He had dwelt there for some time, Dany had realized when she first saw the\n","hill. The air smelled of ash, every rock and tree in sight was scorched and blackened, the\n","ground strewn with burned and broken bones, yet it had been home to him.\n","Dany knew the lure of home.\n","Two days ago, climbing on a spire of rock, she had spied water to the south, a slender\n","thread that glittered briefly as the sun was going down. A stream, Dany decided. Small,\n","but it would lead her to a larger stream, and that stream would flow into some little river,\n","and all the rivers in this part of the world were vassals of the Skahazadhan. Once she\n","found the Skahazadhan she need only follow it downstream to Slaver’s Bay.\n","She would sooner have returned to Meereen on dragon’s wings, to be sure. But that was\n","a desire Drogon did not seem to share.\n","The dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and\n","sorcerous horns. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip. Mounted on the dragon’s\n","back, she oft felt as if she were learning to ride all over again. When she whipped her\n","silver mare on her right flank the mare went left, for a horse’s first instinct is to flee from\n","danger. When she laid the whip across Drogon’s right side he veered right, for a dragon’s\n","first instinct is always to attack. Sometimes it did not seem to matter where she struck\n","him, though; sometimes he went where he would and took her with him. Neither whip nor\n","words could turn Drogon if he did not wish to be turned. The whip annoyed him more\n","than it hurt him, she had come to see; his scales had grown harder than horn.\n","And no matter how far the dragon flew each day, come nightfall some instinct drew him\n","home to Dragonstone. His home, not mine. Her home was back in Meereen, with her\n","husband and her lover. That was where she belonged, surely.\n","Keep walking. If I look back I am lost.\n","Memories walked with her. Clouds seen from above. Horses small as ants thundering\n","through the grass. A silver moon, almost close enough to touch. Rivers running bright and\n","blue below, glimmering in the sun. Will I ever see such sights again? On Drogon’s back\n","she felt whole. Up in the sky the woes of this world could not touch her. How could she\n","abandon that?\n","It was time, though. A girl might spend her life at play, but she was a woman grown, a\n","queen, a wife, a mother to thousands. Her children had need of her. Drogon had bent\n","before the whip, and so must she. She had to don her crown again and return to her ebon\n","bench and the arms of her noble husband.\n","Hizdahr, of the tepid kisses.\n","The sun was hot this morning, the sky blue and cloudless. That was good. Dany’s\n","clothes were hardly more than rags, and offered little in the way of warmth. One of her\n","sandals had slipped off during her wild flight from Meereen and she had left the other up\n","by Drogon’s cave, preferring to go barefoot rather than half-shod. Her tokar and veils she\n","had abandoned in the pit, and her linen undertunic had never been made to withstand the\n","hot days and cold nights of the Dothraki sea. Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and\n","Dany had torn a strip off the hem to make a bandage for her shin. I must look a ragged\n","thing, and starved, she thought, but if the days stay warm, I will not freeze.\n","Hers had been a lonely sojourn, and for most of it she had been hurt and hungry … yet\n","despite it all she had been strangely happy here. A few aches, an empty belly, chills by\n","night … what does it matter when you can fly? I would do it all again.\n","Jhiqui and Irri would be waiting atop her pyramid back in Meereen, she told herself.\n","Her sweet scribe Missandei as well, and all her little pages. They would bring her food,\n","and she could bathe in the pool beneath the persimmon tree. It would be good to feel clean\n","again. Dany did not need a glass to know that she was filthy.\n","She was hungry too. One morning she had found some wild onions growing halfway\n","down the south slope, and later that same day a leafy reddish vegetable that might have\n","been some queer sort of cabbage. Whatever it was, it had not made her sick. Aside from\n","that, and one fish that she had caught in the spring-fed pool outside of Drogon’s cave, she\n","had survived as best she could on the dragon’s leavings, on burned bones and chunks of\n","smoking meat, half-charred and half-raw. She needed more, she knew. One day she kicked\n","at a cracked sheep’s skull with the side of a bare foot and sent it bouncing over the edge of\n","the hill. And as she watched it tumble down the steep slope toward the sea of grass, she\n","realized she must follow.\n","Dany set off through the tall grass at a brisk pace. The earth felt warm between her toes.\n","The grass was as tall as she was. It never seemed so high when I was mounted on my\n","silver, riding beside my sun-and-stars at the head of his khalasar. As she walked, she\n","tapped her thigh with the pitmaster’s whip. That, and the rags on her back, were all she\n","had taken from Meereen.\n","Though she walked through a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer.\n","Even here autumn made its presence felt, and winter would not be far behind. The grass\n","was paler than she remembered, a wan and sickly green on the verge of going yellow.\n","After that would come brown. The grass was dying.\n","Daenerys Targaryen was no stranger to the Dothraki sea, the great ocean of grass that\n","stretched from the forest of Qohor to the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the\n","World. She had seen it first when she was still a girl, newly wed to Khal Drogo and on her\n","way to Vaes Dothrak to be presented to the crones of the dosh khaleen. The sight of all\n","that grass stretching out before her had taken her breath away. The sky was blue, the grass\n","was green, and I was full of hope. Ser Jorah had been with her then, her gruff old bear.\n","She’d had Irri and Jhiqui and Doreah to care for her, her sun-and-stars to hold her in the\n","night, his child growing inside her. Rhaego. I was going to name him Rhaego, and the\n","dosh khaleen said he would be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Not since those halfremembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door had she been\n","as happy.\n","But in the Red Waste, all her joy had turned to ashes. Her sun-and-stars had fallen from\n","his horse, the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had murdered Rhaego in her womb, and Dany had\n","smothered the empty shell of Khal Drogo with her own two hands. Afterward Drogo’s\n","great khalasar had shattered. Ko Pono named himself Khal Pono and took many riders\n","with him, and many slaves as well. Ko Jhaqo named himself Khal Jhaqo and rode off with\n","even more. Mago, his bloodrider, raped and murdered Eroeh, a girl Daenerys had once\n","saved from him. Only the birth of her dragons amidst the fire and smoke of Khal Drogo’s\n","funeral pyre had spared Dany herself from being dragged back to Vaes Dothrak to live out\n","the remainder of her days amongst the crones of the dosh khaleen.\n","The fire burned away my hair, but elsewise it did not touch me. It had been the same in\n","Daznak’s Pit. That much she could recall, though much of what followed was a haze. So\n","many people, screaming and shoving. She remembered rearing horses, a food cart spilling\n","melons as it overturned. From below a spear came flying, followed by a flight of crossbow\n","bolts. One passed so close that Dany felt it brush her cheek. Others skittered off Drogon’s\n","scales, lodged between them, or tore through the membrane of his wings. She remembered\n","the dragon twisting beneath her, shuddering at the impacts, as she tried desperately to\n","cling to his scaled back. The wounds were smoking. Dany saw one of the bolts burst into\n","sudden flame. Another fell away, shaken loose by the beating of his wings. Below, she\n","saw men whirling, wreathed in flame, hands up in the air as if caught in the throes of some\n","mad dance. A woman in a green tokar reached for a weeping child, pulling him down into\n","her arms to shield him from the flames. Dany saw the color vividly, but not the woman’s\n","face. People were stepping on her as they lay tangled on the bricks. Some were on fire.\n","Then all of that had faded, the sounds dwindling, the people shrinking, the spears and\n","arrows falling back beneath them as Drogon clawed his way into the sky. Up and up and\n","up he’d borne her, high above the pyramids and pits, his wings outstretched to catch the\n","warm air rising from the city’s sun baked bricks. If I fall and die, it will still have been\n","worth it, she had thought.\n","North they flew, beyond the river, Drogon gliding on torn and tattered wings through\n","clouds that whipped by like the banners of some ghostly army. Dany glimpsed the shores\n","of Slaver’s Bay and the old Valyrian road that ran beside it through sand and desolation\n","until it vanished in the west. The road home. Then there was nothing beneath them but\n","grass rippling in the wind.\n","Was that first flight a thousand years ago? Sometimes it seemed as if it must be.\n","The sun grew hotter as it rose, and before long her head was pounding. Dany’s hair was\n","growing out again, but slowly. “I need a hat,” she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had\n","tried to make one for herself, weaving stalks of grass together as she had seen Dothraki\n","women do during her time with Drogo, but either she was using the wrong sort of grass or\n","she simply lacked the necessary skill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. Try again,\n","she told herself. You will do better the next time. You are the blood of the dragon, you can\n","make a hat. She tried and tried, but her last attempt had been no more successful than her\n","first.\n","It was afternoon by the time Dany found the stream she had glimpsed atop the hill. It\n","was a rill, a rivulet, a trickle, no wider than her arm … and her arm had grown thinner\n","every day she spent on Dragonstone. Dany scooped up a handful of water and splashed it\n","on her face. When she cupped her hands, her knuckles squished in the mud at the bottom\n","of the stream. She might have wished for colder, clearer water … but no, if she were going\n","to pin her hopes on wishes, she would wish for rescue.\n","She still clung to the hope that someone would come after her. Ser Barristan might\n","come seeking her; he was the first of her Queensguard, sworn to defend her life with his\n","own. And her bloodriders were no strangers to the Dothraki sea, and their lives were\n","bound to her own. Her husband, the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq, might dispatch searchers.\n","And Daario … Dany pictured him riding toward her through the tall grass, smiling, his\n","golden tooth gleaming with the last light of the setting sun.\n","Only Daario had been given to the Yunkai’i, a hostage to ensure no harm came to the\n","Yunkish captains. Daario and Hero, Jhogo and Groleo, and three of Hizdahr’s kin. By\n","now, surely, all of her hostages would have been released. But …\n","She wondered if her captain’s blades still hung upon the wall beside her bed, waiting for\n","Daario to return and claim them. “I will leave my girls with you,” he had said. “Keep them\n","safe for me, beloved.” And she wondered how much the Yunkai’i knew about what her\n","captain meant to her. She had asked Ser Barristan that question the afternoon the hostages\n","went forth. “They will have heard the talk,” he had replied. “Naharis may even have\n","boasted of Your Grace’s … of your great … regard … for him. If you will forgive my\n","saying so, modesty is not one of the captain’s virtues. He takes great pride in his … his\n","swordsmanship.”\n","He boasts of bedding me, you mean. But Daario would not have been so foolish as to\n","make such a boast amongst her enemies. It makes no matter. By now the Yunkai’i will be\n","marching home. That was why she had done all that she had done. For peace.\n","She turned back the way she’d come, to where Dragonstone rose above the grasslands\n","like a clenched fist. It looks so close. I’ve been walking for hours, yet it still looks as if I\n","could reach out and touch it. It was not too late to go back. There were fish in the springfed pool by Drogon’s cave. She had caught one her first day there, she might catch more.\n","And there would be scraps, charred bones with bits of flesh still on them, the remnants of\n","Drogon’s kills.\n","No, Dany told herself. If I look back I am lost. She might live for years amongst the\n","sunbaked rocks of Dragonstone, riding Drogon by day and gnawing at his leavings every\n","evenfall as the great grass sea turned from gold to orange, but that was not the life she had\n","been born to. So once again she turned her back upon the distant hill and closed her ears to\n","the song of flight and freedom that the wind sang as it played amongst the hill’s stony\n","ridges. The stream was trickling south by southeast, as near as she could tell. She followed\n","it. Take me to the river, that is all I ask of you. Take me to the river, and I will do the rest.\n","The hours passed slowly. The stream bent this way and that, and Dany followed,\n","beating time upon her leg with the whip, trying not to think about how far she had to go,\n","or the pounding in her head, or her empty belly. Take one step. Take the next. Another step.\n","Another. What else could she do?\n","It was quiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed\n","against each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now and\n","again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. Mud squished\n","between her toes. Insects buzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps\n","and stinging midges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they\n","landed on her arms. Once she came upon a rat drinking from the stream, but it fled when\n","she appeared, scurrying between the stalks to vanish in the high grass. Sometimes she\n","heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them\n","with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and\n","now I’ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. “Men are mad and gods\n","are madder,” she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement.\n","Thrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have\n","been an eagle, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by\n","now, even when he was no more than a speck. The second time he passed before the sun,\n","his black wings spread, and the world darkened. The last time he flew right above her, so\n","close she could hear the sound of his wings. For half a heartbeat Dany thought that he was\n","hunting her, but he flew on without taking any notice of her and vanished somewhere in\n","the east. Just as well, she thought.\n","Evening took her almost unawares. As the sun was gilding the distant spires of\n","Dragonstone, Dany stumbled onto a low stone wall, overgrown and broken. Perhaps it had\n","been part of a temple, or the hall of the village lord. More ruins lay beyond it—an old\n","well, and some circles in the grass that marked the sites where hovels had once stood.\n","They had been built of mud and straw, she judged, but long years of wind and rain had\n","worn them away to nothing. Dany found eight before the sun went down, but there might\n","have been more farther out, hidden in the grass.\n","The stone wall had endured better than the rest. Though it was nowhere more than three\n","feet high, the angle where it met another, lower wall still offered some shelter from the\n","elements, and night was coming on fast. Dany wedged herself into that corner, making a\n","nest of sorts by tearing up handfuls of the grass that grew around the ruins. She was very\n","tired, and fresh blisters had appeared on both her feet, including a matched set upon her\n","pinky toes. It must be from the way I walk, she thought, giggling.\n","As the world darkened, Dany settled in and closed her eyes, but sleep refused to come.\n","The night was cold, the ground hard, her belly empty. She found herself thinking of\n","Meereen, of Daario, her love, and Hizdahr, her husband, of Irri and Jhiqui and sweet\n","Missandei, Ser Barristan and Reznak and Skahaz Shavepate. Do they fear me dead? I flew\n","off on a dragon’s back. Will they think he ate me? She wondered if Hizdahr was still king.\n","His crown had come from her, could he hold it in her absence? He wanted Drogon dead. I\n","heard him. “Kill it,” he screamed, “kill the beast,” and the look upon his face was lustful.\n","And Strong Belwas had been on his knees, heaving and shuddering. Poison. It had to be\n","poison. The honeyed locusts. Hizdahr urged them on me, but Belwas ate them all. She had\n","made Hizdahr her king, taken him into her bed, opened the fighting pits for him, he had no\n","reason to want her dead. Yet who else could it have been? Reznak, her perfumed\n","seneschal? The Yunkai’i? The Sons of the Harpy?\n","Off in the distance, a wolf howled. The sound made her feel sad and lonely, but no less\n","hungry. As the moon rose above the grasslands, Dany slipped at last into a restless sleep.\n","She dreamed. All her cares fell away from her, and all her pains as well, and she seemed\n","to float upward into the sky. She was flying once again, spinning, laughing, dancing, as\n","the stars wheeled around her and whispered secrets in her ear. “To go north, you must\n","journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward, you must go back. To\n","touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.”\n","“Quaithe?” Dany called. “Where are you, Quaithe?”\n","Then she saw. Her mask is made of starlight.\n","“Remember who you are, Daenerys,” the stars whispered in a woman’s voice. “The\n","dragons know. Do you?”\n","The next morning she woke stiff and sore and aching, with ants crawling on her arms\n","and legs and face. When she realized what they were, she kicked aside the stalks of dry\n","brown grass that had served as her bed and blanket and struggled to her feet. She had bites\n","all over her, little red bumps, itchy and inflamed. Where did all the ants come from? Dany\n","brushed them from her arms and legs and belly. She ran a hand across her stubbly scalp\n","where her hair had burned away, and felt more ants on her head, and one crawling down\n","the back of her neck. She knocked them off and crushed them under her bare feet. There\n","were so many …\n","It turned out that their anthill was on the other side of her wall. She wondered how the\n","ants had managed to climb over it and find her. To them these tumbledown stones must\n","loom as huge as the Wall of Westeros. The biggest wall in all the world, her brother\n","Viserys used to say, as proud as if he’d built it himself.\n","Viserys told her tales of knights so poor that they had to sleep beneath the ancient\n","hedges that grew along the byways of the Seven Kingdoms. Dany would have given much\n","and more for a nice thick hedge. Preferably one without an anthill.\n","The sun was only just coming up. A few bright stars lingered in the cobalt sky. Perhaps\n","one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his fiery stallion in the night lands and smiling down\n","on me. Dragonstone was still visible above the grasslands. It looks so close. I must be\n","leagues away by now, but it looks as if I could be back in an hour. She wanted to lie back\n","down, close her eyes, and give herself up to sleep. No. I must keep going. The stream. Just\n","follow the stream.\n","Dany took a moment to make certain of her directions. It would not do to walk the\n","wrong way and lose her stream. “My friend,” she said aloud. “If I stay close to my friend I\n","won’t get lost.” She would have slept beside the water if she dared, but there were animals\n","who came down to the stream to drink at night. She had seen their tracks. Dany would\n","make a poor meal for a wolf or lion, but even a poor meal was better than none.\n","Once she was certain which way was south, she counted off her paces. The stream\n","appeared at eight. Dany cupped her hands to drink. The water made her belly cramp, but\n","cramps were easier to bear than thirst. She had no other drink but the morning dew that\n","glistened on the tall grass, and no food at all unless she cared to eat the grass. I could try\n","eating ants. The little yellow ones were too small to provide much in the way of\n","nourishment, but there were red ants in the grass, and those were bigger. “I am lost at sea,”\n","she said as she limped along beside her meandering rivulet, “so perhaps I’ll find some\n","crabs, or a nice fat fish.” Her whip slapped softly against her thigh, wap wap wap. One\n","step at a time, and the stream would see her home.\n","Just past midday she came upon a bush growing by the stream, its twisted limbs\n","covered with hard green berries. Dany squinted at them suspiciously, then plucked one\n","from a branch and nibbled at it. Its flesh was tart and chewy, with a bitter aftertaste that\n","seemed familiar to her. “In the khalasar, they used berries like these to flavor roasts,” she\n","decided. Saying it aloud made her more certain of it. Her belly rumbled, and Dany found\n","herself picking berries with both hands and tossing them into her mouth.\n","An hour later, her stomach began to cramp so badly that she could not go on. She spent\n","the rest of that day retching up green slime. If I stay here, I will die. I may be dying now.\n","Would the horse god of the Dothraki part the grass and claim her for his starry khalasar,\n","so she might ride the nightlands with Khal Drogo? In Westeros the dead of House\n","Targaryen were given to the flames, but who would light her pyre here? My flesh will feed\n","the wolves and carrion crows, she thought sadly, and worms will burrow through my\n","womb. Her eyes went back to Dragonstone. It looked smaller. She could see smoke rising\n","from its wind-carved summit, miles away. Drogon has returned from hunting.\n","Sunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning. Every stool was looser than the one\n","before, and smelled fouler. By the time the moon came up she was shitting brown water.\n","The more she drank, the more she shat, but the more she shat, the thirstier she grew, and\n","her thirst sent her crawling to the stream to suck up more water. When she closed her eyes\n","at last, Dany did not know whether she would be strong enough to open them again.\n","She dreamt of her dead brother.\n","Viserys looked just as he had the last time she’d seen him. His mouth was twisted in\n","anguish, his hair was burnt, and his face was black and smoking where the molten gold\n","had run down across his brow and cheeks and into his eyes.\n","“You are dead,” Dany said.\n","Murdered. Though his lips never moved, somehow she could hear his voice, whispering\n","in her ear. You never mourned me, sister. It is hard to die unmourned.\n","“I loved you once.”\n","Once, he said, so bitterly it made her shudder. You were supposed to be my wife, to bear\n","me children with silver hair and purple eyes, to keep the blood of the dragon pure. I took\n","care of you. I taught you who you were. I fed you. I sold our mother’s crown to keep you\n","fed.\n","“You hurt me. You frightened me.”\n","Only when you woke the dragon. I loved you.\n","“You sold me. You betrayed me.”\n","No. You were the betrayer. You turned against me, against your own blood. They\n","cheated me. Your horsey husband and his stinking savages. They were cheats and liars.\n","They promised me a golden crown and gave me this. He touched the molten gold that was\n","creeping down his face, and smoke rose from his finger.\n","“You could have had your crown,” Dany told him. “My sun-and-stars would have won\n","it for you if only you had waited.”\n","I waited long enough. I waited my whole life. I was their king, their rightful king. They\n","laughed at me.\n","“You should have stayed in Pentos with Magister Illyrio. Khal Drogo had to present me\n","to the dosh khaleen, but you did not have to ride with us. That was your choice. Your\n","mistake.”\n","Do you want to wake the dragon, you stupid little whore? Drogo’s khalasar was mine. I\n","bought them from him, a hundred thousand screamers. I paid for them with your\n","maidenhead.\n","“You never understood. Dothraki do not buy and sell. They give gifts and receive them.\n","If you had waited …”\n","I did wait. For my crown, for my throne, for you. All those years, and all I ever got was\n","a pot of molten gold. Why did they give the dragon’s eggs to you? They should have been\n","mine. If I’d had a dragon, I would have taught the world the meaning of our words.\n","Viserys began to laugh, until his jaw fell away from his face, smoking, and blood and\n","molten gold ran from his mouth.\n","When she woke, gasping, her thighs were slick with blood.\n","For a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun to lighten, and\n","the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please, let me sleep some more. I’m so tired.\n","She tried to burrow back beneath the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep.\n","Some of the stalks felt wet. Had it rained again? She sat up, afraid that she had soiled\n","herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on\n","them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass,\n","and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood.\n","If she had not been so sick and scared, that might have come as a relief. Instead she\n","began to shiver violently. She rubbed her fingers through the dirt, and grabbed a handful\n","of grass to wipe between her legs. The dragon does not weep. She was bleeding, but it was\n","only woman’s blood. The moon is still a crescent, though. How can that be? She tried to\n","remember the last time she had bled. The last full moon? The one before? The one before\n","that? No, it cannot have been so long as that. “I am the blood of the dragon,” she told the\n","grass, aloud.\n","Once, the grass whispered back, until you chained your dragons in the dark.\n","“Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was … her name …” Dany could not recall the\n","child’s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been\n","burned away. “I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.”\n","Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children.\n","Her belly was empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping\n","had grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels. She scooped\n","up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid,\n","but in the chill of dawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she\n","splashed her face, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic\n","was stained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it’s only my\n","moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. Could it be the\n","water? If it was the water, she was doomed. She had to drink or die of thirst.\n","“Walk,” Dany commanded herself. “Follow the stream and it will take you to the\n","Skahazadhan. That’s where Daario will find you.” But it took all her strength just to get\n","back to her feet, and when she did all she could do was stand there, fevered and bleeding.\n","She raised her eyes to the empty blue sky, squinting at the sun. Half the morning gone\n","already, she realized, dismayed. She made herself take a step, and then another, and then\n","she was walking once again, following the little stream.\n","The day grew warmer, and the sun beat down upon her head and the burnt remnants of\n","her hair. Water splashed against the soles of her feet. She was walking in the stream. How\n","long had she been doing that? The soft brown mud felt good between her toes and helped\n","to soothe her blisters. In the stream or out of it, I must keep walking. Water flows downhill.\n","The stream will take me to the river, and the river will take me home.\n","Except it wouldn’t, not truly.\n","Meereen was not her home, and never would be. It was a city of strange men with\n","strange gods and stranger hair, of slavers wrapped in fringed tokars, where grace was\n","earned through whoring, butchery was art, and dog was a delicacy. Meereen would always\n","be the Harpy’s city, and Daenerys could not be a harpy.\n","Never, said the grass, in the gruff tones of Jorah Mormont. You were warned, Your\n","Grace. Let this city be, I said. Your war is in Westeros, I told you.\n","The voice was no more than a whisper, yet somehow Dany felt that he was walking just\n","behind her. My bear, she thought, my old sweet bear, who loved me and betrayed me. She\n","had missed him so. She wanted to see his ugly face, to wrap her arms around him and\n","press herself against his chest, but she knew that if she turned around Ser Jorah would be\n","gone. “I am dreaming,” she said. “A waking dream, a walking dream. I am alone and\n","lost.”\n","Lost, because you lingered, in a place that you were never meant to be, murmured Ser\n","Jorah, as softly as the wind. Alone, because you sent me from your side.\n","“You betrayed me. You informed on me, for gold.”\n","For home. Home was all I ever wanted.\n","“And me. You wanted me.” Dany had seen it in his eyes.\n","I did, the grass whispered, sadly.\n","“You kissed me. I never said you could, but you did. You sold me to my enemies, but\n","you meant it when you kissed me.”\n","I gave you good counsel. Save your spears and swords for the Seven Kingdoms, I told\n","you. Leave Meereen to the Meereenese and go west, I said. You would not listen.\n","“I had to take Meereen or see my children starve along the march.” Dany could still see\n","the trail of corpses she had left behind her crossing the Red Waste. It was not a sight she\n","wished to see again. “I had to take Meereen to feed my people.”\n","You took Meereen, he told her, yet still you lingered.\n","“To be a queen.”\n","You are a queen, her bear said. In Westeros.\n","“It is such a long way,” she complained. “I was tired, Jorah. I was weary of war. I\n","wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.”\n","No. You are the blood of the dragon. The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser\n","Jorah were falling farther behind. Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. Remember who\n","you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.\n","“Fire and Blood,” Daenerys told the swaying grass.\n","A stone turned under her foot. She stumbled to one knee and cried out in pain, hoping\n","against hope that her bear would gather her up and help her to her feet. When she turned\n","her head to look for him, all she saw was trickling brown water … and the grass, still\n","moving slightly. The wind, she told herself, the wind shakes the stalks and makes them\n","sway. Only no wind was blowing. The sun was overhead, the world still and hot. Midges\n","swarmed in the air, and a dragonfly floated over the stream, darting here and there. And\n","the grass was moving when it had no cause to move.\n","She fumbled in the water, found a stone the size of her fist, pulled it from the mud. It\n","was a poor weapon but better than an empty hand. From the corner of her eye Dany saw\n","the grass move again, off to her right. The grass swayed and bowed low, as if before a\n","king, but no king appeared to her. The world was green and empty. The world was green\n","and silent. The world was yellow, dying. I should get up, she told herself. I have to walk. I\n","have to follow the stream.\n","Through the grass came a soft silvery tinkling.\n","Bells, Dany thought, smiling, remembering Khal Drogo, her sun-and-stars, and the bells\n","he braided into his hair. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas\n","go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves, when my womb quickens again and I\n","bear a living child, Khal Drogo will return to me.\n","But none of those things had happened. Bells, Dany thought again. Her bloodriders had\n","found her. “Aggo,” she whispered. “Jhogo. Rakharo.” Might Daario have come with\n","them?\n","The green sea opened. A rider appeared. His braid was black and shiny, his skin as dark\n","as burnished copper, his eyes the shape of bitter almonds. Bells sang in his hair. He wore a\n","medallion belt and painted vest, with an arakh on one hip and a whip on the other. A\n","hunting bow and a quiver of arrows were slung from his saddle.\n","One rider, and alone. A scout. He was one who rode before the khalasar to find the\n","game and the good green grass, and sniff out foes wherever they might hide. If he found\n","her there, he would kill her, rape her, or enslave her. At best, he would send her back to the\n","crones of the dosh khaleen, where good khaleesi were supposed to go when their khals\n","had died.\n","He did not see her, though. The grass concealed her, and he was looking elsewhere.\n","Dany followed his eyes, and there the shadow flew, with wings spread wide. The dragon\n","was a mile off, and yet the scout stood frozen until his stallion began to whicker in fear.\n","Then he woke as if from a dream, wheeled his mount about, and raced off through the tall\n","grass at a gallop.\n","Dany watched him go. When the sound of his hooves had faded away to silence, she\n","began to shout. She called until her voice was hoarse … and Drogon came, snorting\n","plumes of smoke. The grass bowed down before him. Dany leapt onto his back. She stank\n","of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that mattered. “To go forward I must go back,”\n","she said. Her bare legs tightened around the dragon’s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon\n","threw himself into the sky. Her whip was gone, so she used her hands and feet and turned\n","him north by east, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he\n","smelled the rider’s fear.\n","In a dozen heartbeats they were past the Dothraki, as he galloped far below. To the right\n","and left, Dany glimpsed places where the grass was burned and ashen. Drogon has come\n","this way before, she realized. Like a chain of grey islands, the marks of his hunting dotted\n","the green grass sea.\n","A vast herd of horses appeared below them. There were riders too, a score or more, but\n","they turned and fled at the first sight of the dragon. The horses broke and ran when the\n","shadow fell upon them, racing through the grass until their sides were white with foam,\n","tearing the ground with their hooves … but as swift as they were, they could not fly. Soon\n","one horse began to lag behind the others. The dragon descended on him, roaring, and all at\n","once the poor beast was aflame, yet somehow he kept on running, screaming with every\n","step, until Drogon landed on him and broke his back. Dany clutched the dragon’s neck\n","with all her strength to keep from sliding off.\n","The carcass was too heavy for him to bear back to his lair, so Drogon consumed his kill\n","there, tearing at the charred flesh as the grasses burned around them, the air thick with\n","drifting smoke and the smell of burnt horsehair. Dany, starved, slid off his back and ate\n","with him, ripping chunks of smoking meat from the dead horse with bare, burned hands.\n","In Meereen I was a queen in silk, nibbling on stuffed dates and honeyed lamb, she\n","remembered. What would my noble husband think if he could see me now? Hizdahr would\n","be horrified, no doubt. But Daario …\n","Daario would laugh, carve off a hunk of horsemeat with his arakh, and squat down to\n","eat beside her.\n","As the western sky turned the color of a blood bruise, she heard the sound of\n","approaching horses. Dany rose, wiped her hands on her ragged undertunic, and went to\n","stand beside her dragon.\n","That was how Khal Jhaqo found her, when half a hundred mounted warriors emerged\n","from the drifting smoke.\n","\n","EPILOGUE\n","I am no traitor,” the Knight of Griffin’s Roost declared. “I am King Tommen’s man, and\n","yours.”\n","A steady drip-drip-drip punctuated his words, as snowmelt ran off his cloak to puddle\n","on the floor. The snow had been falling on King’s Landing most of the night; outside the\n","drifts were ankle deep. Ser Kevan Lannister pulled his cloak about himself more closely.\n","“So you say, ser. Words are wind.”\n","“Then let me prove the truth of them with my sword.” The light of the torches made a\n","fiery blaze of Ronnet Connington’s long red hair and beard. “Send me against my uncle,\n","and I will bring you back his head, and the head of this false dragon too.”\n","Lannister spearmen in crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms stood along the west\n","wall of the throne room. Tyrell guards in green cloaks faced them from the opposite wall.\n","The chill in the throne room was palpable. Though neither Queen Cersei nor Queen\n","Margaery was amongst them, their presence could be felt poisoning the air, like ghosts at a\n","feast.\n","Behind the table where the five members of the king’s small council were seated, the\n","Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast, its barbs and claws and blades halfshrouded in shadow. Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back, an itch between the\n","shoulder blades. It was easy to imagine old King Aerys perched up there, bleeding from\n","some fresh cut, glowering down. But today the throne was empty. He had seen no reason\n","for Tommen to join them. Kinder to let the boy remain with his mother. The Seven only\n","knew how long mother and son might have together before Cersei’s trial … and possibly\n","her execution.\n","Mace Tyrell was speaking. “We shall deal with your uncle and his feigned boy in due\n","time.” The new King’s Hand was seated on an oaken throne carved in the shape of a hand,\n","an absurd vanity his lordship had produced the day Ser Kevan agreed to grant him the\n","office he coveted. “You will bide here until we are ready to march. Then you shall have\n","the chance to prove your loyalty.”\n","Ser Kevan took no issue with that. “Escort Ser Ronnet back to his chambers,” he said.\n","And see that he remains there went unspoken. However loud his protestations, the Knight\n","of Griffin’s Roost remained suspect. Supposedly the sellswords who had landed in the\n","south were being led by one of his own blood.\n","As the echoes of Connington’s footsteps faded away, Grand Maester Pycelle gave a\n","ponderous shake of his head. “His uncle once stood just where the boy was standing now\n","and told King Aerys how he would deliver him the head of Robert Baratheon.”\n","That is how it is when a man grows as old as Pycelle. Everything you see or hear\n","reminds you of something you saw or heard when you were young. “How many men-at-\n","arms accompanied Ser Ronnet to the city?” Ser Kevan asked.\n","“Twenty,” said Lord Randyll Tarly, “and most of them Gregor Clegane’s old lot. Your\n","nephew Jaime gave them to Connington. To rid himself of them, I’d wager. They had not\n","been in Maidenpool a day before one killed a man and another was accused of rape. I had\n","to hang the one and geld the other. If it were up to me, I would send them all to the Night’s\n","Watch, and Connington with them. The Wall is where such scum belong.”\n","“A dog takes after its master,” declared Mace Tyrell. “Black cloaks would suit them, I\n","agree. I will not suffer such men in the city watch.” A hundred of his own Highgarden\n","men had been added to the gold cloaks, yet plainly his lordship meant to resist any\n","balancing infusion of westermen.\n","The more I give him, the more he wants. Kevan Lannister was beginning to understand\n","why Cersei had grown so resentful of the Tyrells. But this was not the moment to provoke\n","an open quarrel. Randyll Tarly and Mace Tyrell had both brought armies to King’s\n","Landing, whilst the best part of the strength of House Lannister remained in the riverlands,\n","fast melting away. “The Mountain’s men were always fighters,” he said in a conciliatory\n","tone, “and we may have need of every sword against these sellswords. If this truly is the\n","Golden Company, as Qyburn’s whisperers insist—”\n","“Call them what you will,” said Randyll Tarly. “They are still no more than\n","adventurers.”\n","“Perhaps,” Ser Kevan said. “But the longer we ignore these adventurers, the stronger\n","they grow. We have had a map prepared, a map of the incursions. Grand Maester?”\n","The map was beautiful, painted by a master’s hand on a sheet of the finest vellum, so\n","large it covered the table. “Here.” Pycelle pointed with a spotted hand. Where the sleeve\n","of his robe rode up, a flap of pale flesh could be seen dangling beneath his forearm. “Here\n","and here. All along the coast, and on the islands. Tarth, the Stepstones, even Estermont.\n","And now we have reports that Connington is moving on Storm’s End.”\n","“If it is Jon Connington,” said Randyll Tarly.\n","“Storm’s End.” Lord Mace Tyrell grunted the words. “He cannot take Storm’s End. Not\n","if he were Aegon the Conqueror. And if he does, what of it? Stannis holds it now. Let the\n","castle pass from one pretender to another, why should that trouble us? I shall recapture it\n","after my daughter’s innocence is proved.”\n","How can you recapture it when you have never captured it to begin with? “I understand,\n","my lord, but—”\n","Tyrell did not let him finish. “These charges against my daughter are filthy lies. I ask\n","again, why must we play out this mummer’s farce? Have King Tommen declare my\n","daughter innocent, ser, and put an end to the foolishness here and now.”\n","Do that, and the whispers will follow Margaery the rest of her life. “No man doubts\n","your daughter’s innocence, my lord,” Ser Kevan lied, “but His High Holiness insists upon\n","a trial.”\n","Lord Randyll snorted. “What have we become, when kings and high lords must dance\n","to the twittering of sparrows?”\n","“We have foes on every hand, Lord Tarly,” Ser Kevan reminded him. “Stannis in the\n","north, ironmen in the west, sellswords in the south. Defy the High Septon, and we will\n","have blood running in the gutters of King’s Landing as well. If we are seen to be going\n","against the gods, it will only drive the pious into the arms of one or the other of these\n","would-be usurpers.”\n","Mace Tyrell remained unmoved. “Once Paxter Redwyne sweeps the ironmen from the\n","seas, my sons will retake the Shields. The snows will do for Stannis, or Bolton will. As for\n","Connington …”\n","“If it is him,” Lord Randyll said.\n","“… as for Connington,” Tyrell repeated, “what victories has he ever won that we should\n","fear him? He could have ended Robert’s Rebellion at Stoney Sept. He failed. Just as the\n","Golden Company has always failed. Some may rush to join them, aye. The realm is well\n","rid of such fools.”\n","Ser Kevan wished that he could share his certainty. He had known Jon Connington,\n","slightly—a proud youth, the most headstrong of the gaggle of young lordlings who had\n","gathered around Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, competing for his royal favor. Arrogant, but\n","able and energetic. That, and his skill at arms, was why Mad King Aerys had named him\n","Hand. Old Lord Merryweather’s inaction had allowed the rebellion to take root and\n","spread, and Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert’s own youth and\n","vigor. “Too soon,” Lord Tywin Lannister had declared when word of the king’s choice had\n","reached Casterly Rock. “Connington is too young, too bold, too eager for glory.”\n","The Battle of the Bells had proved the truth of that. Ser Kevan had expected that\n","afterward Aerys would have no choice but to summon Tywin once more … but the Mad\n","King had turned to the Lords Chelsted and Rossart instead, and paid for it with life and\n","crown. That was all so long ago, though. If this is indeed Jon Connington, he will be a\n","different man. Older, harder, more seasoned … more dangerous. “Connington may have\n","more than the Golden Company. It is said he has a Targaryen pretender.”\n","“A feigned boy is what he has,” said Randyll Tarly.\n","“That may be. Or not.” Kevan Lannister had been here, in this very hall when Tywin\n","had laid the bodies of Prince Rhaegar’s children at the foot of the Iron Throne, wrapped up\n","in crimson cloaks. The girl had been recognizably the Princess Rhaenys, but the boy … a\n","faceless horror of bone and brain and gore, a few hanks of fair hair. None of us looked\n","long. Tywin said that it was Prince Aegon, and we took him at his word. “We have these\n","tales coming from the east as well. A second Targaryen, and one whose blood no man can\n","question. Daenerys Stormborn.”\n","“As mad as her father,” declared Lord Mace Tyrell.\n","That would be the same father that Highgarden and House Tyrell supported to the bitter\n","end and well beyond. “Mad she may be,” Ser Kevan said, “but with so much smoke\n","drifting west, surely there must be some fire burning in the east.”\n","Grand Maester Pycelle bobbed his head. “Dragons. These same stories have reached\n","Oldtown. Too many to discount. A silver-haired queen with three dragons.”\n","“At the far end of the world,” said Mace Tyrell. “Queen of Slaver’s Bay, aye. She is\n","welcome to it.”\n","“On that we can agree,” Ser Kevan said, “but the girl is of the blood of Aegon the\n","Conqueror, and I do not think she will be content to remain in Meereen forever. If she\n","should reach these shores and join her strength to Lord Connington and this prince of his,\n","feigned or no … we must destroy Connington and his pretender now, before Daenerys\n","Stormborn can come west.”\n","Mace Tyrell crossed his arms. “I mean to do just that, ser. After the trials.”\n","“Sellswords fight for coin,” declared Grand Maester Pycelle. “With enough gold, we\n","might persuade the Golden Company to hand over Lord Connington and the pretender.”\n","“Aye, if we had gold,” Ser Harys Swyft said. “Alas, my lords, our vaults contain only\n","rats and roaches. I have written again to the Myrish bankers. If they will agree to make\n","good the crown’s debt to the Braavosi and extend us a new loan, mayhaps we will not\n","have to raise the taxes. Elsewise—”\n","“The magisters of Pentos have been known to lend money as well,” said Ser Kevan.\n","“Try them.” The Pentoshi were even less like to be of help than the Myrish money\n","changers, but the effort must be made. Unless a new source of coin could be found, or the\n","Iron Bank persuaded to relent, he would have no choice but to pay the crown’s debts with\n","Lannister gold. He dare not resort to new taxes, not with the Seven Kingdoms crawling\n","with rebellion. Half the lords in the realm could not tell taxation from tyranny, and would\n","bolt to the nearest usurper in a heartbeat if it would save them a clipped copper. “If that\n","fails, you may well need to go to Braavos, to treat with the Iron Bank yourself.”\n","Ser Harys quailed. “Must I?”\n","“You are the master of coin,” Lord Randyll said sharply.\n","“I am.” The puff of white hair at the end of Swyft’s chin quivered in outrage. “Must I\n","remind my lord, this trouble is not of my doing? And not all of us have had the\n","opportunity to refill our coffers with the plunder of Maidenpool and Dragonstone.”\n","“I resent your implication, Swyft,” Mace Tyrell said, bristling. “No wealth was found\n","on Dragonstone, I promise you. My son’s men have searched every inch of that damp and\n","dreary island and turned up not so much as a single gemstone or speck of gold. Nor any\n","sign of this fabled hoard of dragon eggs.”\n","Kevan Lannister had seen Dragonstone with his own eyes. He doubted very much that\n","Loras Tyrell had searched every inch of that ancient stronghold. The Valyrians had raised\n","it, after all, and all their works stank of sorcery. And Ser Loras was young, prone to all the\n","rash judgments of youth, and had been grievously wounded storming the castle besides.\n","But it would not do to remind Tyrell that his favorite son was fallible. “If there was wealth\n","on Dragonstone, Stannis would have found it,” he declared. “Let us move along, my lords.\n","We have two queens to try for high treason, you may recall. My niece has elected trial by\n","battle, she informs me. Ser Robert Strong will champion her.”\n","“The silent giant.” Lord Randyll grimaced.\n","“Tell me, ser, where did this man come from?” demanded Mace Tyrell. “Why have we\n","never heard his name before? He does not speak, he will not show his face, he is never\n","seen without his armor. Do we know for a certainty that he is even a knight?”\n","We do not even know if he’s alive. Meryn Trant claimed that Strong took neither food\n","nor drink, and Boros Blount went so far as to say he had never seen the man use the privy.\n","Why should he? Dead men do not shit. Kevan Lannister had a strong suspicion of just who\n","this Ser Robert really was beneath that gleaming white armor. A suspicion that Mace\n","Tyrell and Randyll Tarly no doubt shared. Whatever the face hidden behind Strong’s helm,\n","it must remain hidden for now. The silent giant was his niece’s only hope. And pray that\n","he is as formidable as he appears.\n","But Mace Tyrell could not seem to see beyond the threat to his own daughter. “His\n","Grace named Ser Robert to the Kingsguard,” Ser Kevan reminded him, “and Qyburn\n","vouches for the man as well. Be that as it may, we need Ser Robert to prevail, my lords. If\n","my niece is proved guilty of these treasons, the legitimacy of her children will be called\n","into question. If Tommen ceases to be a king, Margaery will cease to be a queen.” He let\n","Tyrell chew on that a moment. “Whatever Cersei may have done, she is still a daughter of\n","the Rock, of mine own blood. I will not let her die a traitor’s death, but I have made sure\n","to draw her fangs. All her guards have been dismissed and replaced with my own men. In\n","place of her former ladies-in-waiting, she will henceforth be attended by a septa and three\n","novices selected by the High Septon. She is to have no further voice in the governance of\n","the realm, nor in Tommen’s education. I mean to return her to Casterly Rock after the trial\n","and see that she remains there. Let that suffice.”\n","The rest he left unsaid. Cersei was soiled goods now, her power at an end. Every\n","baker’s boy and beggar in the city had seen her in her shame and every tart and tanner\n","from Flea Bottom to Pisswater Bend had gazed upon her nakedness, their eager eyes\n","crawling over her breasts and belly and woman’s parts. No queen could expect to rule\n","again after that. In gold and silk and emeralds Cersei had been a queen, the next thing to a\n","goddess; naked, she was only human, an aging woman with stretch marks on her belly and\n","teats that had begun to sag … as the shrews in the crowds had been glad to point out to\n","their husbands and lovers. Better to live shamed than die proud, Ser Kevan told himself.\n","“My niece will make no further mischief,” he promised Mace Tyrell. “You have my word\n","on that, my lord.”\n","Tyrell gave a grudging nod. “As you say. My Margaery prefers to be tried by the Faith,\n","so the whole realm can bear witness to her innocence.”\n","If your daughter is as innocent as you’d have us believe, why must you have your army\n","present when she faces her accusers? Ser Kevan might have asked. “Soon, I hope,” he\n","said instead, before turning to Grand Maester Pycelle. “Is there aught else?”\n","The Grand Maester consulted his papers. “We should address the Rosby inheritance. Six\n","claims have been put forth—”\n","“We can settle Rosby at some later date. What else?”\n","“Preparations should be made for Princess Myrcella.”\n","“This is what comes of dealing with the Dornish,” Mace Tyrell said. “Surely a better\n","match can be found for the girl?”\n","Such as your own son Willas, perhaps? Her disfigured by one Dornishman, him\n","crippled by another? “No doubt,” Ser Kevan said, “but we have enemies enough without\n","offending Dorne. If Doran Martell were to join his strength to Connington’s in support of\n","this feigned dragon, things could go very ill for all of us.”\n","“Mayhaps we can persuade our Dornish friends to deal with Lord Connington,” Ser\n","Harys Swyft said with an irritating titter. “That would save a deal of blood and trouble.”\n","“It would,” Ser Kevan said wearily. Time to put an end to this. “Thank you, my lords.\n","Let us convene again five days hence. After Cersei’s trial.”\n","“As you say. May the Warrior lend strength to Ser Robert’s arms.” The words were\n","grudging, the dip of the chin Mace Tyrell gave the Lord Regent the most cursory of bows.\n","But it was something, and for that much Ser Kevan Lannister was grateful.\n","Randyll Tarly left the hall with his liege lord, their green-cloaked spearmen right behind\n","them. Tarly is the real danger, Ser Kevan reflected as he watched their departure. A\n","narrow man, but iron-willed and shrewd, and as good a soldier as the Reach could boast.\n","But how do I win him to our side?\n","“Lord Tyrell loves me not,” Grand Maester Pycelle said in gloomy tones when the Hand\n","had departed. “This matter of the moon tea … I would never have spoken of such, but the\n","Queen Dowager commanded me! If it please the Lord Regent, I would sleep more soundly\n","if you could lend me some of your guards.”\n","“Lord Tyrell might take that amiss.”\n","Ser Harys Swyft tugged at his chin beard. “I am in need of guards myself. These are\n","perilous times.”\n","Aye, thought Kevan Lannister, and Pycelle is not the only council member our Hand\n","would like to replace. Mace Tyrell had his own candidate for lord treasurer: his uncle,\n","Lord Seneschal of Highgarden, whom men called Garth the Gross. The last thing I need is\n","another Tyrell on the small council. He was already outnumbered. Ser Harys was his\n","wife’s father, and Pycelle could be counted upon as well. But Tarly was sworn to\n","Highgarden, as was Paxter Redwyne, lord admiral and master of ships, presently sailing\n","his fleet around Dorne to deal with Euron Greyjoy’s ironmen. Once Redwyne returned to\n","King’s Landing, the council would stand at three and three, Lannister and Tyrell.\n","The seventh voice would be the Dornishwoman now escorting Myrcella home. The\n","Lady Nym. But no lady, if even half of what Qyburn reports is true. A bastard daughter of\n","the Red Viper, near as notorious as her father and intent on claiming the council seat that\n","Prince Oberyn himself had occupied so briefly. Ser Kevan had not yet seen fit to inform\n","Mace Tyrell of her coming. The Hand, he knew, would not be pleased. The man we need is\n","Littlefinger. Petyr Baelish had a gift for conjuring dragons from the air.\n","“Hire the Mountain’s men,” Ser Kevan suggested. “Red Ronnet will have no further use\n","for them.” He did not think that Mace Tyrell would be so clumsy as to try to murder either\n","Pycelle or Swyft, but if guards made them feel safer, let them have guards.\n","The three men walked together from the throne room. Outside the snow was swirling\n","round the outer ward, a caged beast howling to be free. “Have you ever felt such cold?”\n","asked Ser Harys.\n","“The time to speak of the cold,” said Grand Maester Pycelle, “is not when we are\n","standing out in it.” He made his slow way across the outer ward, back to his chambers.\n","The others lingered for a moment on the throne room steps. “I put no faith in these\n","Myrish bankers,” Ser Kevan told his good-father. “You had best prepare to go to\n","Braavos.”\n","Ser Harys did not look happy at the prospect. “If I must. But I say again, this trouble is\n","not of my doing.”\n","“No. It was Cersei who decided that the Iron Bank would wait for their due. Should I\n","send her to Braavos?”\n","Ser Harys blinked. “Her Grace … that … that …”\n","Ser Kevan rescued him. “That was a jape. A bad one. Go and find a warm fire. I mean\n","to do the same.” He yanked his gloves on and set off across the yard, leaning hard into the\n","wind as his cloak snapped and swirled behind him.\n","The dry moat surrounding Maegor’s Holdfast was three feet deep in snow, the iron\n","spikes that lined it glistening with frost. The only way in or out of Maegor’s was across\n","the drawbridge that spanned that moat. A knight of the Kingsguard was always posted at\n","its far end. Tonight the duty had fallen to Ser Meryn Trant. With Balon Swann hunting the\n","rogue knight Darkstar down in Dorne, Loras Tyrell gravely wounded on Dragonstone, and\n","Jaime vanished in the riverlands, only four of the White Swords remained in King’s\n","Landing, and Ser Kevan had thrown Osmund Kettleblack (and his brother Osfryd) into the\n","dungeon within hours of Cersei’s confessing that she had taken both men as lovers. That\n","left only Trant, the feeble Boros Blount, and Qyburn’s mute monster Robert Strong to\n","protect the young king and royal family.\n","I will need to find some new swords for the Kingsguard. Tommen should have seven\n","good knights about him. In the past the Kingsguard had served for life, but that had not\n","stopped Joffrey from dismissing Ser Barristan Selmy to make a place for his dog, Sandor\n","Clegane. Kevan could make use of that precedent. I could put Lancel in a white cloak, he\n","reflected. There is more honor in that than he will ever find in the Warrior’s Sons.\n","Kevan Lannister hung his snow-sodden cloak inside his solar, pulled off his boots, and\n","commanded his serving man to fetch some fresh wood for his fire. “A cup of mulled wine\n","would go down well,” he said as he settled by the hearth. “See to it.”\n","The fire soon thawed him, and the wine warmed his insides nicely. It also made him\n","sleepy, so he dare not drink another cup. His day was far from done. He had reports to\n","read, letters to write. And supper with Cersei and the king. His niece had been subdued\n","and submissive since her walk of atonement, thank the gods. The novices who attended\n","her reported that she spent a third of her waking hours with her son, another third in\n","prayer, and the rest in her tub. She was bathing four or five times a day, scrubbing herself\n","with horsehair brushes and strong lye soap, as if she meant to scrape her skin off.\n","She will never wash the stain away, no matter how hard she scrubs. Ser Kevan\n","remembered the girl she once had been, so full of life and mischief. And when she’d\n","flowered, ahhhh … had there ever been a maid so sweet to look upon? If Aerys had agreed\n","to marry her to Rhaegar, how many deaths might have been avoided? Cersei could have\n","given the prince the sons he wanted, lions with purple eyes and silver manes … and with\n","such a wife, Rhaegar might never have looked twice at Lyanna Stark. The northern girl\n","had a wild beauty, as he recalled, though however bright a torch might burn it could never\n","match the rising sun.\n","But it did no good to brood on lost battles and roads not taken. That was a vice of old\n","done men. Rhaegar had wed Elia of Dorne, Lyanna Stark had died, Robert Baratheon had\n","taken Cersei to bride, and here they were. And tonight his own road would take him to his\n","niece’s chambers and face-to-face with Cersei.\n","I have no reason to feel guilty, Ser Kevan told himself. Tywin would understand that,\n","surely. It was his daughter who brought shame down on our name, not I. What I did I did\n","for the good of House Lannister.\n","It was not as if his brother had never done the same. In their father’s final years, after\n","their mother’s passing, their sire had taken the comely daughter of a candlemaker as\n","mistress. It was not unknown for a widowed lord to keep a common girl as\n","bedwarmer … but Lord Tytos soon began seating the woman beside him in the hall,\n","showering her with gifts and honors, even asking her views on matters of state. Within a\n","year she was dismissing servants, ordering about his household knights, even speaking for\n","his lordship when he was indisposed. She grew so influential that it was said about\n","Lannisport that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her\n","and speak loudly to her lap … for Tytos Lannister’s ear was between his lady’s legs. She\n","had even taken to wearing their mother’s jewels.\n","Until the day their lord father’s heart had burst in his chest as he was ascending a steep\n","flight of steps to her bed, that is. All the self-seekers who had named themselves her\n","friends and cultivated her favor had abandoned her quickly enough when Tywin had her\n","stripped naked and paraded through Lannisport to the docks, like a common whore.\n","Though no man laid a hand on her, that walk spelled the end of her power. Surely Tywin\n","would never have dreamed that same fate awaited his own golden daughter.\n","“It had to be,” Ser Kevan muttered over the last of his wine. His High Holiness had to\n","be appeased. Tommen needed the Faith behind him in the battles to come. And\n","Cersei … the golden child had grown into a vain, foolish, greedy woman. Left to rule, she\n","would have ruined Tommen as she had Joffrey.\n","Outside the wind was rising, clawing at the shutters of his chamber. Ser Kevan pushed\n","himself to his feet. Time to face the lioness in her den. We have pulled her claws. Jaime,\n","though … But no, he would not brood on that.\n","He donned an old, well-worn doublet, in case his niece had a mind to throw another cup\n","of wine in his face, but he left his sword belt hanging on the back of his chair. Only the\n","knights of the Kingsguard were permitted swords in Tommen’s presence.\n","Ser Boros Blount was in attendance on the boy king and his mother when Ser Kevan\n","entered the royal chambers. Blount wore enameled scale, white cloak, and halfhelm. He\n","did not look well. Of late Boros had grown notably heavier about the face and belly, and\n","his color was not good. And he was leaning against the wall behind him, as if standing had\n","become too great an effort for him.\n","The meal was served by three novices, well-scrubbed girls of good birth between the\n","ages of twelve and sixteen. In their soft white woolens, each seemed more innocent and\n","unworldly than the last, yet the High Septon had insisted that no girl spend more than\n","seven days in the queen’s service, lest Cersei corrupt her. They tended the queen’s\n","wardrobe, drew her bath, poured her wine, changed her bedclothes of a morning. One\n","shared the queen’s bed every night, to ascertain she had no other company; the other two\n","slept in an adjoining chamber with the septa who looked over them.\n","A tall stork of a girl with a pockmarked face escorted him into the royal presence.\n","Cersei rose when he entered and kissed him lightly on the cheek. “Dear uncle. It is so\n","good of you to sup with us.” The queen was dressed as modestly as any matron, in a dark\n","brown gown that buttoned up to her throat and a hooded green mantle that covered her\n","shaved head. Before her walk she would have flaunted her baldness beneath a golden\n","crown. “Come, sit,” she said. “Will you have wine?”\n","“A cup.” He sat, still wary.\n","A freckled novice filled their cups with hot spiced wine. “Tommen tells me that Lord\n","Tyrell intends to rebuild the Tower of the Hand,” Cersei said.\n","Ser Kevan nodded. “The new tower will be twice as tall as the one you burned, he\n","says.”\n","Cersei gave a throaty laugh. “Long lances, tall towers … is Lord Tyrell hinting at\n","something?”\n","That made him smile. It is good that she still remembers how to laugh. When he asked\n","if she had all that she required, the queen said, “I am well served. The girls are sweet, and\n","the good septas make certain that I say my prayers. But once my innocence is proved, it\n","would please me if Taena Merryweather might attend me once again. She could bring her\n","son to court. Tommen needs other boys about him, friends of noble birth.”\n","It was a modest request. Ser Kevan saw no reason why it should not be granted. He\n","could foster the Merryweather boy himself, whilst Lady Taena accompanied Cersei back\n","to Casterly Rock. “I will send for her after the trial,” he promised.\n","Supper began with beef-and-barley soup, followed by a brace of quail and a roast pike\n","near three feet long, with turnips, mushrooms, and plenty of hot bread and butter. Ser\n","Boros tasted every dish that was set before the king. A humiliating duty for a knight of the\n","Kingsguard, but perhaps all Blount was capable of these days … and wise, after the way\n","Tommen’s brother had died.\n","The king seemed happier than Kevan Lannister had seen him in a long time. From soup\n","to sweet Tommen burbled about the exploits of his kittens, whilst feeding them morsels of\n","pike off his own royal plate. “The bad cat was outside my window last night,” he informed\n","Kevan at one point, “but Ser Pounce hissed at him and he ran off across the roofs.”\n","“The bad cat?” Ser Kevan said, amused. He is a sweet boy.\n","“An old black tomcat with a torn ear,” Cersei told him. “A filthy thing, and foultempered. He clawed Joff’s hand once.” She made a face. “The cats keep the rats down, I\n","know, but that one … he’s been known to attack ravens in the rookery.”\n","“I will ask the ratters to set a trap for him.” Ser Kevan could not remember ever seeing\n","his niece so quiet, so subdued, so demure. All for the good, he supposed. But it made him\n","sad as well. Her fire is quenched, she who used to burn so bright. “You have not asked\n","about your brother,” he said, as they were waiting for the cream cakes. Cream cakes were\n","the king’s favorite.\n","Cersei lifted her chin, her green eyes shining in the candlelight. “Jaime? Have you had\n","word?”\n","“None. Cersei, you may need to prepare yourself for—”\n","“If he were dead, I would know it. We came into this world together, Uncle. He would\n","not go without me.” She took a drink of wine. “Tyrion can leave whenever he wishes. You\n","have had no word of him either, I suppose.”\n","“No one has tried to sell us a dwarf’s head of late, no.”\n","She nodded. “Uncle, may I ask you a question?”\n","“Whatever you wish.”\n","“Your wife … do you mean to bring her to court?”\n","“No.” Dorna was a gentle soul, never comfortable but at home with friends and kin\n","around her. She had done well by their children, dreamed of having grandchildren, prayed\n","seven times a day, loved needlework and flowers. In King’s Landing she would be as\n","happy as one of Tommen’s kittens in a pit of vipers. “My lady wife mislikes travel.\n","Lannisport is her place.”\n","“It is a wise woman who knows her place.”\n","He did not like the sound of that. “Say what you mean.”\n","“I thought I did.” Cersei held out her cup. The freckled girl filled it once again. The\n","cream cakes appeared then, and the conversation took a lighter turn. Only after Tommen\n","and his kittens were escorted off to the royal bedchamber by Ser Boros did their talk turn\n","to the queen’s trial.\n","“Osney’s brothers will not stand by idly and watch him die,” Cersei warned him.\n","“I did not expect that they would. I’ve had the both of them arrested.”\n","That seemed to take her aback. “For what crime?”\n","“Fornication with a queen. His High Holiness says that you confessed to bedding both\n","of them—had you forgotten?”\n","Her face reddened. “No. What will you do with them?”\n","“The Wall, if they admit their guilt. If they deny it, they can face Ser Robert. Such men\n","should never have been raised so high.”\n","Cersei lowered her head. “I … I misjudged them.”\n","“You misjudged a good many men, it seems.”\n","He might have said more, but the dark-haired novice with the round cheeks returned to\n","say, “My lord, my lady, I am sorry to intrude, but there is a boy below. Grand Maester\n","Pycelle begs the favor of the Lord Regent’s presence at once.”\n","Dark wings, dark words, Ser Kevan thought. Could Storm’s End have fallen? Or might\n","this be word from Bolton in the north?\n","“It might be news of Jaime,” the queen said.\n","There was only one way to know. Ser Kevan rose. “Pray excuse me.” Before he took his\n","leave, he dropped to one knee and kissed his niece upon the hand. If her silent giant failed\n","her, it might be the last kiss she would ever know.\n","The messenger was a boy of eight or nine, so bundled up in fur he seemed a bear cub.\n","Trant had kept him waiting out on the drawbridge rather than admit him into Maegor’s.\n","“Go find a fire, lad,” Ser Kevan told him, pressing a penny into his hand. “I know the way\n","to the rookery well enough.”\n","The snow had finally stopped falling. Behind a veil of ragged clouds, a full moon\n","floated fat and white as a snowball. The stars shone cold and distant. As Ser Kevan made\n","his way across the inner ward, the castle seemed an alien place, where every keep and\n","tower had grown icy teeth, and all familiar paths had vanished beneath a white blanket.\n","Once an icicle long as a spear fell to shatter by his feet. Autumn in King’s Landing, he\n","brooded. What must it be like up on the Wall?\n","The door was opened by a serving girl, a skinny thing in a fur-lined robe much too big\n","for her. Ser Kevan stamped the snow off his boots, removed his cloak, tossed it to her.\n","“The Grand Maester is expecting me,” he announced. The girl nodded, solemn and silent,\n","and pointed to the steps.\n","Pycelle’s chambers were beneath the rookery, a spacious suite of rooms cluttered with\n","racks of herbs and salves and potions and shelves jammed full of books and scrolls. Ser\n","Kevan had always found them uncomfortably hot. Not tonight. Once past the chamber\n","door, the chill was palpable. Black ash and dying embers were all that remained of the\n","hearthfire. A few flickering candles cast pools of dim light here and there.\n","The rest was shrouded in shadow … except beneath the open window, where a spray of\n","ice crystals glittered in the moonlight, swirling in the wind. On the window seat a raven\n","loitered, pale, huge, its feathers ruffled. It was the largest raven that Kevan Lannister had\n","ever seen. Larger than any hunting hawk at Casterly Rock, larger than the largest owl.\n","Blowing snow danced around it, and the moon painted it silver.\n","Not silver. White. The bird is white.\n","The white ravens of the Citadel did not carry messages, as their dark cousins did. When\n","they went forth from Oldtown, it was for one purpose only: to herald a change of seasons.\n","“Winter,” said Ser Kevan. The word made a white mist in the air. He turned away from\n","the window.\n","Then something slammed him in the chest between the ribs, hard as a giant’s fist. It\n","drove the breath from him and sent him lurching backwards. The white raven took to the\n","air, its pale wings slapping him about the head. Ser Kevan half-sat and half-fell onto the\n","window seat. What … who … A quarrel was sunk almost to the fletching in his chest. No.\n","No, that was how my brother died. Blood was seeping out around the shaft. “Pycelle,” he\n","muttered, confused. “Help me … I …”\n","Then he saw. Grand Maester Pycelle was seated at his table, his head pillowed on the\n","great leather-bound tome before him. Sleeping, Kevan thought … until he blinked and saw\n","the deep red gash in the old man’s spotted skull and the blood pooled beneath his head,\n","staining the pages of his book. All around his candle were bits of bone and brain, islands\n","in a lake of melted wax.\n","He wanted guards, Ser Kevan thought. I should have sent him guards. Could Cersei\n","have been right all along? Was this his nephew’s work? “Tyrion?” he called. “Where …?”\n","“Far away,” a half-familiar voice replied.\n","He stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase, plump, pale-faced, round-shouldered,\n","clutching a crossbow in soft powdered hands. Silk slippers swaddled his feet.\n","“Varys?”\n","The eunuch set the crossbow down. “Ser Kevan. Forgive me if you can. I bear you no\n","ill will. This was not done from malice. It was for the realm. For the children.”\n","I have children. I have a wife. Oh, Dorna. Pain washed over him. He closed his eyes,\n","opened them again. “There are … there are hundreds of Lannister guardsmen in this\n","castle.”\n","“But none in this room, thankfully. This pains me, my lord. You do not deserve to die\n","alone on such a cold dark night. There are many like you, good men in service to bad\n","causes … but you were threatening to undo all the queen’s good work, to reconcile\n","Highgarden and Casterly Rock, bind the Faith to your little king, unite the Seven\n","Kingdoms under Tommen’s rule. So …”\n","A gust of wind blew up. Ser Kevan shivered violently.\n","“Are you cold, my lord?” asked Varys. “Do forgive me. The Grand Maester befouled\n","himself in dying, and the stink was so abominable that I thought I might choke.”\n","Ser Kevan tried to rise, but the strength had left him. He could not feel his legs.\n","“I thought the crossbow fitting. You shared so much with Lord Tywin, why not that?\n","Your niece will think the Tyrells had you murdered, mayhaps with the connivance of the\n","Imp. The Tyrells will suspect her. Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the\n","Dornishmen. Doubt, division, and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king,\n","whilst Aegon raises his banner above Storm’s End and the lords of the realm gather round\n","him.”\n","“Aegon?” For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A babe swaddled\n","in a crimson cloak, the cloth stained with his blood and brains. “Dead. He’s dead.”\n","“No.” The eunuch’s voice seemed deeper. “He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule\n","since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that\n","was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has\n","studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith\n","since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his\n","hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He\n","can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be\n","hunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that\n","kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.”\n","Kevan Lannister tried to cry out … to his guards, his wife, his brother … but the words\n","would not come. Blood dribbled from his mouth. He shuddered violently.\n","“I am sorry.” Varys wrung his hands. “You are suffering, I know, yet here I stand going\n","on like some silly old woman. Time to make an end to it.” The eunuch pursed his lips and\n","gave a little whistle.\n","Ser Kevan was cold as ice, and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through\n","him. He glimpsed movement, heard the soft scuffling sound of slippered feet on stone. A\n","child emerged from a pool of darkness, a pale boy in a ragged robe, no more than nine or\n","ten. Another rose up behind the Grand Maester’s chair. The girl who had opened the door\n","for him was there as well. They were all around him, half a dozen of them, white-faced\n","children with dark eyes, boys and girls together.\n","And in their hands, the daggers.''', '''oi eu sou um easter egg e vc me achou hihi''', '''INICIO\n","1 banana amassada\n","1 ovo\n","1 colher de sopa de amaranto\n","FIM\n","INICIO\n","1 ovo\n","1 colher de sopa de farinha de amêndoas, amaranto ou quino (o que\n","preferir)\n","1 colher de cha de mel\n","Canela a gosto\n","FIM\n","INICIO\n","1 kiwi\n","5 folhas de espinafre\n","Suco de 1 limão\n","1 cabinho de hortelã\n","Gelo a gosto\n","1 col.

Durante uma hora,\n","pelo menos, mantínhamos profundo silêncio; cada um de nós, aos olhos de algum observador\n","casual, teria parecido intensa e exclusivamente ocupado com as volutas de fumaça que\n","tornavam densa a atmosfera do aposento. Quanto a mim, no entanto, discutia mentalmente\n","certos tópicos que haviam constituído o assunto da conversa entre nós na primeira parte da\n","noite. Retiro-me ao caso da Rua Morgue e ao mistério que envolvia o assassínio de Marie\n","Rogêt. Pareceu-me, pois, quase que uma coincidência, quando a porta de nosso apartamento\n","se abriu e entrou o nosso velho conhecido, Monsieur G..., delegado de polícia de Paris.\n","Recebemo-lo com cordialidade, pois havia nele tanto de desprezível como de divertido, e\n","não o víamos havia já vários anos. Tínhamos estado sentados no escuro e, a entrada do\n","visitante, Dupin se ergueu para acender a luz, mas sentou-se de novo sem o fazer, depois que\n","G... nos disse que nos visitava para consultar-nos, ou melhor, para pedir a opinião de meu\n","amigo sobre alguns casos oficiais que lhe haviam causado grandes transtornos.\n","— Se se trata de um caso que requer reflexão — disse Dupin —, desistindo de acender\n","a mecha, será melhor examinado no escuro.\n","— Esta é outra de suas estranhas idéias — comentou o delegado, que tinha o costume de\n","'chamar \"estranhas\" todas as coisas que estavam além de sua compreensão e que, desse modo,\n","vivia em meio de uma legião inteira de “estranhezas”.\n","— Exatamente — disse Dupiu, enquanto oferecia um cachimbo ao visitante e empurrava\n","para junto dele uma confortável poltrona.\n","— E qual é agora a dificuldade? — perguntei. — Espero que não seja nada que se refira a\n","assassínios.\n","— Oh, não! Nada disso! Trata-se, na verdade, de um caso muito simples, e não tenha\n","dúvida de que podemos resolvê-lo satisfatoriamente. Mas, depois, pensei que Dupin talvez\n","gostaria de conhecer alguns de seus pormenores, que são bastante estranhos.\n","— Um caso simples e estranho — comentou Dupin.\n","— Sim, realmente; mas por outro lado, não é nem uma coisa nem outra. O fato é que todos\n","nós ficamos muito intrigados, pois, embora tão simples, o caso escapa inteiramente a nossa\n","compreensão.\n","— Talvez seja a sua própria simplicidade que os desorienta — disse o meu amigo.\n","— Ora, que tolice — exclamou o delegado, rindo cordialmente.\n","— Talvez o mistério seja um pouco simples demais — disse Dupin.\n","— Oh, Deus do céu! Quem já ouviu tal coisa?\n","— Um pouco evidente demais.\n","O delegado de polícia prorrompeu em sonora gargalhada, divertindo-se a valer:\n","— Oh, Dupin, você ainda acaba por me matar de riso!\n","— E qual é, afinal de contas, o caso em apreço? — perguntei.\n","— Pois eu lhes direi — respondeu o delegado, refestelando-se na poltrona, enquanto tirava\n","longa e meditativa baforada do cachimbo. — Direi tudo em poucas palavras; mas, antes de\n","começar, permitam-me recomendar que este caso exige o maior sigilo. Perderia,\n","provavelmente, o lugar que hoje ocupo, se soubessem que eu o confiei a alguém.\n","— Continue — disse eu.\n","— Ou não diga nada — acrescentou Dupin.\n","— Bem. Recebi informações pessoais, de fonte muito elevada, de que certo documento da\n","máxima importância foi roubado dos aposentos reais. Sabe-se quem foi a pessoa que o\n","roubou. Quanto a isso, não há a menor dúvida; viram-na apoderar-se dele. Sabe-se, também,\n","que o documento continua em poder da referida pessoa.\n","— Como se sabe disso? — indagou Dupin.\n","— É coisa que se deduz claramente — respondeu o delegado — pela natureza de tal\n","documento e pelo fato de não terem surgido certas conseqüências que surgiriam incontinente,\n","se o documento não estivesse ainda em poder do ladrão, isto é, se já houvesse sido utilizado\n","com o fim que este último se propõe.\n","— Seja um pouco mais explícito — pedi.\n","— Bem, atrevo-me a dizer que esse documento dá a quem o possua um certo poder, num\n","meio em que tal poder é imensamente valioso.\n","O delegado apreciava muito as tiradas diplomáticas.\n","— Ainda não entendo bem — disse Dupin.\n","— Não? Bem. A exibição desse documento a uma terceira pessoa, cujo nome não\n","mencionarei, comprometeria a honra de uma personalidade da mais alta posição, e tal fato\n","concede à pessoa que possui o documento ascendência sobre essa personalidade ilustre, cuja\n","honra e tranqüilidade se acham, assim, ameaçadas.\n","— Mas essa ascendência — intervim — depende de que o ladrão saiba que a pessoa\n","roubada o conhece. Quem se atreveria.\n","— O ladrão — disse G... — é o Ministro D..., que se atreve a tudo, tanto o que é digno\n","como o que é indigno de um homem. O roubo foi cometido de modo não só engenhoso como\n","ousado. O documento em questão... uma carta, para sermos francos, foi recebida pela\n","personalidade roubada quando esta se encontrava a sós em seus aposentos. Quando a lia, foi\n","subitamente interrompida pela entrada de outra personalidade de elevada posição, de quem\n","desejava particularmente ocultar a carta. Após tentar às pressas, e em vão, metê-la numa\n","gaveta, foi obrigada a colocá-la, aberta como estava, sobre uma mesa. O sobrescrito, porém,\n","estava em cima e o conteúdo, por conseguinte, ficou resguardado. Nesse momento, entra o\n","Ministro D... Seus olhos de lince percebem imediatamente a carta, e ele reconhece a letra do\n","sobrescrito, observa a confusão da destinatária e penetra em seu segredo. Depois de tratar de\n","alguns assuntos, na sua maneira apressada de sempre, tira do bolso uma carta parecida com a\n","outra em questão, abre-a, finge lê-la e, depois, coloca-a bem ao lado da primeira. Torna a\n","conversar, durante uns quinze minutos, sobre assuntos públicos. Por fim, ao retirar-se, tira de\n","cima da mesa a carta que não lhe pertencia. Seu verdadeiro dono viu tudo, certamente, mas\n","não ousou chamar-lhe a atenção em presença da terceira personagem, que se achava ao seu\n","lado. O ministro retirou-se, deixando sua carta — uma carta sem importância — sobre a\n","mesa.\n","— Aí tem você — disse-me Dupin — exatamente o que seria necessário para tornar\n","completa tal ascendência: o ladrão sabe que a pessoa roubada o conhece.\n","— Sim — confirmou o delegado — e o poder conseguido dessa maneira tem sido\n","empregado, há vários meses, para fins políticos, até um ponto muito perigoso. A pessoa\n","roubada esta cada dia mais convencida de que é necessário reaver a carta. Mas isso, por certo,\n","não pode ser feito abertamente. Por fim, levada ao desespero, encarregou-me dessa tarefa.\n","— Não lhe teria sido possível, creio eu — disse Dupin, em meio a uma perfeita espiral de \n","fumaça —, escolher ou sequer imaginar um agente mais sagaz.\n","— Você me lisonjeia — respondeu o delegado —, mas é possível que haja pensado mais\n","ou menos isso.\n","— Está claro, como acaba de observar — disse eu —, que a carta se encontra ainda em\n","poder do ministro, pois é a posse da carta, e não qualquer emprego da mesma, que lhe confere\n","poder. Se ele a usar, o poder se dissipa.\n","— Certo — concordou G... — e foi baseado nessa convicção que principiei a agir. Meu\n","primeiro cuidado foi realizar uma pesquisa completa no hotel em que mora o ministro. A\n","principal dificuldade reside no fato de ser necessário fazer tal investigação sem que ele saiba.\n","Além disso preveniram-me do perigo, caso ele venha a suspeitar de nosso propósito.\n","— Mas — disse eu — o senhor está perfeitamente a par dessas investigações. A polícia\n","parisiense já fez isso muitas vezes, anteriormente.\n","— É verdade. Por essa razão, não desesperei. Os hábitos do ministro me proporcionam,\n","sobretudo, uma grande vantagem. Com freqüência, passa a noite toda fora de casa. Seus\n","criados não são numerosos. Dormem longe do apartamento de seu amo e, como quase todos\n","são napolitanos, não é difícil fazer com que se embriaguem. Como sabe, tenho chaves que\n","podem abrir qualquer aposento ou gabinete em Paris. Durante três meses, não houve uma\n","noite sequer em que eu não me empenhasse, pessoalmente em esquadrinhar o Hotel D...\n","Minha honra está em jogo e, para mencionar um grande segredo, a recompensa é enorme. De\n","modo que não abandonarei as pesquisas enquanto não me convencer inteiramente de que o\n","ladrão é mais astuto do que eu. Creio haver investigado todos os cantos e esconderijos em\n","que o papel pudesse estar oculto.\n","— Mas não seria possível — lembrei — que, embora a carta possa estar em poder do\n","ministro, como indiscutivelmente está, ele a tenha escondido em outro lugar que sua própria\n","casa?\n","— É pouco provável — respondeu Dupin. - A situação atual, particularíssima, dos assuntos\n","da corte e principalmente as intrigas em que, como se sabe, D... anda envolvido, fazem da\n","eficácia imediata do documento — da possibilidade de ser apresentado a qualquer momento\n","— um ponto quase tão importante quanto a sua posse.\n","— A possibilidade de ser apresentado? — perguntei.\n","— O que vale dizer, de ser destruído — disse Dupin.\n","— É certo — observei. — Não há dúvida de que o documento se encontra nos aposentos\n","do ministro. Quanto a estar consigo próprio, guardado em seus bolsos, é coisa que podemos\n","considerar como fora da questão.\n","— De acordo — disse o delegado. Por duas vezes, já fiz com que fosse revistado, sob\n","minhas próprias vistas, por batedores de carteiras.\n","— Podia ter evitado todo esse trabalho — comentou Dupin. — D..., creio eu, não é\n","inteiramente idiota e, assim, deve ter previsto, como coisa corriqueira, essas “revistas”.\n","— Não é inteiramente tolo — disse G... —, mas é poeta, o que o coloca não muito distante\n","de um tolo.\n","— Certo — assentiu Dupin, após longa e pensativa baforada de seu cachimbo —,\n","embora eu também seja culpado de certos versos.\n","— Que tal se nos contasse, com pormenores. como se processou a busca? — sugeri.\n","— Pois bem. Examinamos, demoradamente, todos os cantos. Tenho longa experiência\n","dessas coisas. Vasculhamos o edifício inteiro, quarto por quarto, dedicando as noites de toda\n","uma semana a cada um deles. Examinamos, primeiro, os móveis de cada aposento. Abrimos\n","todas as gavetas possíveis, e presumo que os senhores saibam que, para um agente de polícia\n","devidamente habilitado, não existem gavetas secretas. Seria um bobalhão aquele que\n","permitisse que uma gaveta \"secreta\" escapasse à sua observação numa pesquisa como essa. A\n","coisa é demasiado simples. Há um certo tamanho — um certo espaço — que se deve levar \n","em conta em cada escrivaninha. Além disso, dispomos de regras precisas. Nem a\n","qüinquagésima parte de uma linha nos passaria despercebida. Depois das mesas de trabalho,\n","examinamos as cadeiras. As almofadas foram submetidas ao teste das agulhas. que os\n","senhores já me viram empregar. Removemos a parte superior das mesas.\n","— Para quê?\n","— As vezes, a parte superior de uma mesa, ou de outro móvel semelhante, é removida pela\n","pessoa que deseja ocultar um objeto; depois, a perna é escavada, o objeto depositado dentro\n","da cavidade e a parte superior recolocada em seu lugar. Os pés e a parte superior das colunas\n","das camas são utilizados para o mesmo fim.\n","— Mas não se poderia descobrir a parte oca por meio de som? — perguntei.\n","— De modo algum, se quando o objeto lá colocado for envolto por algodão. Além disso,\n","em nosso caso, somos obrigados a agir sem fazer barulho.\n","— Mas o senhor não poderia ter removido. . . não poderia ter examinado, peça por peça,\n","todos os móveis em que teria sido possível ocultar alguma coisa da maneira a que se referiu.\n","Uma carta pode ser transformada em minúscula espiral, não muito diferente, em forma e em\n","volume, de uma agulha grande de costura e, desse modo, pode ser introduzida na travessa de\n","uma cadeira, por exemplo. Naturalmente, o senhor não desmontou todas as cadeiras, não é\n","verdade?\n","— Claro que não. Mas fizemos melhor: examinamos as travessas de todas as cadeiras\n","existentes no hotel e, também, as juntas de toda a espécie de móveis. Fizemo-lo com a ajuda\n","de poderoso microscópio. Se houvesse sinais de alterações recentes, não teríamos deixado de\n","notar imediatamente. Um simples grão de pó de verruma, por exemplo, teria sido tão evidente\n","como uma maçã. Qualquer alteração na cola — qualquer coisa pouco comum nas junturas —\n","seria o bastante para chamar-nos a atenção.\n","— Presumo que examinaram os espelhos, entre as tábuas e os vidros, bem como as camas,\n","as roupas de cama, as cortinas e os tapetes.\n","— Naturalmente! E, depois de examinar desse modo, com a máxima minuciosidade, todos\n","os móveis, passamos a examinar a própria casa. Dividimos toda a sua superfície em\n","compartimentos, que eram por nós numerados, a fim de que nenhum pudesse ser esquecido.\n","Depois, vasculhamos os aposentos palmo a palmo, inclusive as duas casas contíguas. E isso\n","com a ajuda do microscópio, como antes.\n","— As duas casas contíguas?! — exclamei. — Devem ter tido muito trabalho!\n","— Tivemos. Mas a recompensa oferecida é, como já disse, muito grande.\n","— Incluíram também os terrenos dessas casas?\n","— Todos os terrenos são revestidos de tijolos. Deram-nos, relativamente, pouco\n","trabalho. Examinamos o musgo existente entre os tijolos, verificamos que não havia nenhuma\n","alteração.\n","— Naturalmente, olharam também os papéis de D. . . E os livros da biblioteca?\n","— Sem dúvida. Abrimos todos os pacotes e embrulhos, e não só abrimos todos os\n","volumes, mas os folheamos página por página, sem que nos contentássemos com uma\n","simples sacudida, como é hábito entre alguns de nossos policiais. Medimos também a\n","espessura de cada encadernação, submetendo cada uma delas ao mais escrupuloso exame\n","microscópico. Se qualquer encadernação apresentasse sinais de que havia sofrido alteração\n","recente, tal fato não nos passaria despercebido. Quanto a uns cinco ou seis volumes, recémchegados das mãos do encadernador, foram por nós cuidadosamente examinados, em sentido\n","longitudinal, por meio de agulha.\n","— Verificaram os assoalhos, embaixo dos tapetes?\n","— Sem dúvida. Tiramos todos os tapetes e examinamos as tábuas do assoalho com o\n","microscópio.\n","— E o papel das paredes?\n","— Também.\n","— Deram uma busca no porão?\n","— Demos.\n","— Então — disse eu — os senhores se enganaram, pois a carta não está na casa, como o\n","senhor supõe.\n","— Temo que o senhor tenha razão quanto a isso, concordou o delegado. E agora Dupin,\n","que é que aconselharia fazer?\n","— Uma nova e completa investigação na casa.\n","— Isso é inteiramente inútil — replicou G. . . — Não estou tão certo de que respiro como\n","de que a carta não está no hotel.\n","— Não tenho melhor conselho para dar-lhe — disse Dupin. — O senhor, naturalmente,\n","possui uma descrição precisa da carta, não e assim?\n","— Certamente!\n","E, aqui, tirando do bolso um memorando, o delegado de polícia pôs-se a ler, em voz alta,\n","uma descrição minuciosa do aspecto interno e, principalmente, externo do documento\n","roubado. Logo depois de terminar a leitura, partiu muito mais deprimido do que eu jamais o\n","vira antes.\n","Decorrido cerca de um mês, fez-nos outra visita, e encontrou-nos entregues à mesma\n","ocupação que na vez anterior. Apanhou um cachimbo e uma poltrona e passou a conversar\n","sobre assuntos corriqueiros. Por fim, perguntei:\n","— Então, Monsieur G. . . , que nos diz da carta roubada? Suponho que se convenceu,\n","afinal, de que não é coisa simples ser mais astuto que o ministro.\n","— Que o diabo carregue o ministro! — exclamou.\n","Sim, realizei, apesar de tudo, um novo exame, como Dupin sugeriu. Mas trabalho perdido,\n","como eu sabia que seria.\n","— Qual foi a recompensa oferecida, a que se referiu? — indagou Dupin.\n","— Ora, uma recompensa muito grande . . . muito generosa. . . Mas não me agrada dizer\n","quanto, precisamente. Direi, no entanto, que não me importaria de dar, de meu cheque\n","cinqüenta mil francos a quem conseguisse obter essa carta. A verdade é que ela se torna, a\n","cada dia que passa, mais importante. . . e a recompensa foi, ultimamente, dobrada. Mas,\n","mesmo que fosse triplicada, eu não poderia fazer mais do que já fiz.\n","— Pois sim — disse Dupin, arrastando as palavras, entre as baforadas de seu cachimbo de\n","espuma —, realmente. Parece-me. . . no entanto. . . G. . . que não se esforçou ao máximo\n","quanto a este assunto. . . Creio que poderia fazer um pouco mais, bem?\n","— Como? De que maneira?\n","— Ora (baforada), poderia (baforada) fazer uma consulta sobre este assunto, hein?\n","(baforada). Lembra-se da história que se conta a respeito de Abernethy?\n","— Não. Que vá para o diabo Abernethy!\n","— Sim, que vá para o diabo e seja bem recebido! Mas, certa vez, um avarento rico\n","concebeu a idéia de obter de graça uma consulta de Ahernethy. Com tal fim, durante uma\n","conversa entre um grupo de amigos, insinuou o seu caso ao médico, como se se tratasse do\n","caso de um indivíduo imaginário.\n","— “Suponhamos” — disse o avaro — que seus sintomas sejam tais e tais. Nesse caso, que\n","é que o doutor lhe aconselharia tomar?\"\n","— ”Tomar! Aconselharia, claro, que tomasse um conselho.\"\n","— Mas — disse o delegado, um tanto desconcertado — estou inteiramente disposto a\n","ouvir um conselho e a pagar por ele. Daria, realmente, cinqüenta mil francos a quem quer que\n","me ajudasse nesse assunto.\n","— Nesse caso — respondeu Dupin, abrindo uma gaveta e retirando um livro de cheques \n","— pode encher um cheque nessa quantia. Quando o houver assinado, eu lhe entregarei\n","a carta.\n","Fiquei perplexo. O delegado parecia fulminado por um raio. Durante alguns minutos,\n","permaneceu mudo e imóvel, olhando, incrédulo e boquiaberto, o meu amigo, com os olhos\n","quase a saltar-lhe das órbitas. Depois, parecendo voltar, de certo modo, a si, apanhou uma\n","caneta e, após várias pausas e olhares vagos, preencheu, finalmente, um cheque de cinqüenta\n","mil francos, entregando-o, por cima da mesa, a Dupin. Este o examinou cuidadosamente e o\n","colocou na carteira; depois, abrindo uma escrivaninha, tirou dela uma carta e entregou-a ao\n","delegado de polícia. O funcionário apanhou-a tomado como que de um espasmo de alegria.\n","abriu-a com mãos trêmulas, lançou rápido olhar ao seu conteúdo e, depois, agarrando a porta\n","e lutando por abri-la, precipitou-se, por fim, sem a menor cerimônia, para fora do\n","apartamento e da casa, sem proferir uma única palavra desde o momento em que Dupin lhe\n","pediu para preencher o cheque.\n","Depois de sua partida, meu amigo entrou em algumas explicações.\n","— A polícia parisiense — disse ele — é extremamente hábil á sua maneira. Seus agentes\n","são perseverantes, engenhosos, astutos e perfeitamente versados nos conhecimentos que seus\n","deveres parecem exigir de modo especial. Assim, quando G . . . nos contou,\n","pormenorizadamente, a maneira pela qual realizou suas pesquisas no Hotel D . . ., não tive\n","dúvida de que efetuara uma investigação satisfatória . . . até o ponto a que chegou o seu\n","trabalho.\n","— Até o ponto a que chegou o seu trabalho? — perguntei.\n","— Sim — respondeu Dupin. — As medidas adotadas não foram apenas as melhores que\n","poderiam ser tomadas, mas realizadas com absoluta perfeição. Se a carta estivesse depositada\n","dentro do raio de suas investigações, esses rapazes, sem dúvida, a teriam encontrado.\n","Ri, simplesmente — mas ele parecia haver dito tudo aquilo com a máxima seriedade.\n","— As medidas, pois — prosseguiu —, eram boas em seu gênero, e foram bem executadas:\n","seu defeito residia em serem inaplicáveis ao caso e ao homem em questão. Um certo conjunto\n","de recursos altamente engenhosos é, para o delegado, uma espécie de leito de Procusto, ao\n","qual procura adaptar à força todos os seus planos. Mas, no caso em apreço, cometeu uma\n","série de erros, por ser demasiado profundo ou demasiado superficial, e muitos colegiais\n","raciocinam melhor do que ele. Conheci um garotinho de oito anos cujo êxito como\n","adivinhador, no jogo de \"par ou ímpar\", despertava a admiração de todos. Este jogo é simples\n","e se joga com bolinhas de vidro. Um dos participantes fecha na mão algumas bolinhas e\n","pergunta ao outro se o número é par ou ímpar. Se o companheiro acerta, ganha uma bolinha;\n","se erra, perde uma. O menino a que me refiro ganhou todas as bolinhas de vidro da escola.\n","Naturalmente, tinha um sistema de adivinhação que consistia na simples observação e no\n","cálculo da astúcia de seus oponentes. Suponhamos, por exemplo, que seu adversário fosse um\n","bobalhão que, fechando a mão, lhe perguntasse: \"Par ou ímpar?\" Nosso garoto responderia\n","\"ímpar\", e perderia; mas, na segunda vez, ganharia, pois diria com os seus botões: \"Este\n","bobalhão tirou par na primeira vez, e sua astúcia é apenas suficiente para que apresente um\n","número ímpar na segunda vez. Direi, pois, ímpar\". Diz ímpar e ganha. Ora, com um\n","simplório um pouco menos tolo que o primeiro, ele teria raciocinado assim: \"Este sujeito viu\n","que, na primeira vez, eu disse ímpar e, na segunda, proporá a si mesmo, levado por um\n","impulso a variar de ímpar para par, como fez o primeiro simplório; mas, pensando melhor,\n","acha que essa variação é demasiado simples, e, finalmente, resolve-se a favor do par, como\n","antes. Eu, por conseguinte, direi par”. E diz par, e ganha. Pois bem. Esse sistema de\n","raciocínio de nosso colegial, que seus companheiros chamavam sorte, o que era, em última\n","análise?\n","— Simplesmente — respondi — uma identificação do intelecto do nosso raciocinador\n","com o do seu oponente.\n","— De fato — assentiu Dupin — e, quando perguntei ao menino de que modo efetuava\n","essa perfeita identificação, na qual residia o teu êxito, recebi a seguinte resposta:\n","\"Quando quero saber até que ponto alguém é inteligente, estúpido, bom ou mau, ou quais são\n","os seus pensamentos no momento, modelo a expressão de meu rosto, tão exatamente quanto\n","possível, de acordo com a expressão da referida pessoa e, depois, espero para ver quais os\n","sentimentos ou pensamentos que surgem em meu cérebro ou em meu coração, para combinar\n","ou corresponder à expressão”. Essa resposta do pequeno colegial supera em muito toda a\n","profundidade espúria atribuída a Rochefoucauld, La Bougive, Maquiavel e Campanella.\n","— E a identificação — acrescentei — do intelecto do raciocinador com o de seu\n","oponente depende, se é que o compreendo bem, da exatidão com que o intelecto deste último\n","é medido.\n","— Em sua avaliação prática, depende disso — confirmou Dupin. — E, se o delegado e\n","toda a sua corte têm cometido tantos enganos, isso se deve, primeiro, a uma falha nessa\n","identificação e, segundo, a uma apreciação inexata, ou melhor, a uma não apreciação da\n","inteligência daqueles com quem se metem. Consideram engenhosas apenas as suas próprias\n","idéias e, ao procurar alguma coisa que se ache escondida, não pensam senão nos meios que\n","eles próprios teriam empregado para escondê-la. Estão certos apenas num ponto: naquele em\n","que sua engenhosidade representa fielmente a da massa; mas, quando a astúcia do mal-feitor\n","é diferente da deles, o malfeitor, naturalmente, os engana. Isso sempre acontece quando a\n","astúcia deste último está acima da deles e, muito freqüentemente, quando está abaixo. Não\n","variam seu sistema de investigação; na melhor das hipóteses, quando são instigados por\n","algum caso insólito, ou por alguma recompensa extraordinária, ampliam ou exageram os seus\n","modos de agir habituais, sem que se afastem, no entanto, de seus princípios. No caso de D. . .,\n","por exemplo, que fizeram para mudar sua maneira de agir? Que são todas essas perfurações,\n","essas buscas, essas sondagens, esses exames de microscópio, essa divisão da superfície do\n","edifício em polegadas quadradas, devidamente anotadas? Que é tudo isso senão exagero na\n","aplicação de um desses princípios de investigação baseados sobre uma ordem de idéias\n","referentes à esperteza humana, à qual o delegado se habituou durante os longos anos de\n","exercício de suas funções? Não vê você que ele considera como coisa assente o fato de que\n","todos os homens que procuram esconder uma carta utilizam, se não precisamente um orifício\n","feito a verruma na perna de uma cadeira, pelo menos alguma cavidade, algum canto escuro\n","sugerido pela mesma ordem de idéias que levaria um homem a furar a perna de uma cadeira?\n","E não vê também que tais esconderijos tão recherchés só são empregados em ocasiões\n","ordinárias e por inteligências comuns? Porque, em todos os casos de objetos escondidos, essa\n","maneira recherché de ocultar-se um objeto é, desde o primeiro momento, presumível e\n","presumida — e, assim, sua descoberta não depende, de modo algum, da perspicácia, mas sim\n","do simples cuidado, da paciência e da determinação dos que procuram. Mas, quando se trata\n","de um caso importante — ou de um caso que, pela recompensa oferecida, seja assim\n","encarado pela polícia — jamais essas qualidades deixaram de ser postas em ação. Você\n","compreenderá, agora, o que eu queria dizer ao afirmar que, se a carta roubada tivesse sido\n","escondida dentro do raio de investigação do nosso delegado — ou, em outras palavras, se o\n","princípio inspirador estivesse compreendido nos princípios do delegado —, sua descoberta\n","seria uma questão inteiramente fora de dúvida. Este funcionário, porém, se enganou por\n","completo, e a fonte remota de seu fracasso reside na suposição de que o ministro é um idiota,\n","pois adquiriu renome de poeta. Segundo o delegado, todos os poetas são idiotas — e, neste\n","caso, ele é apenas culpado de uma non distributio medii, ao inferir que todos os poetas são\n","idiotas.\n","— Mas ele é realmente poeta? — perguntei. — Sei que são dois irmãos, e que ambos\n","adquiriram renome nas letras. O ministro, creio eu, escreveu eruditamente sobre o cálculo\n","diferencial. É um matemático, e não um poeta.\n","— Você está enganado. Conheço-o bem. E ambas as coisas. Como poeta e matemático,\n","raciocinaria bem; como mero matemático, não raciocinaria de modo algum, e ficaria, assim, à\n","mercê do delegado.\n","— Você me surpreende — respondi — com essas opiniões, que têm sido desmentidas pela\n","voz do mundo. Naturalmente, não quererá destruir, de um golpe, idéias amadurecidas durante\n","tantos séculos. A razão matemática é há muito considerada como a razão par excellence.\n","— “Il y a à parier” — replicou Dupin, citando Chamfort — “que toute idée publique, toute\n","convention reçue, est une sottise, car elle a convenu au plus grande nombre.” Os\n","matemáticos, concordo, fizeram tudo o que lhes foi possível para propagar o erro popular a\n","que você alude, e que, por ter sido promulgado como verdade, não deixa de ser erro. Como\n","uma arte digna de melhor causa, ensinaram-nos a aplicar o termo \"análise\" às operações\n","algébricas. Os franceses são os culpados originários desse engano particular, mas, se um\n","termo possui alguma importância — se as palavras derivam seu valor de sua aplicabilidade\n","—, então análise poderá significar algebra, do mesmo modo que, em latim, ambitus significa\n","ambição, religio, religião, ou homines honesti um grupo de homens honrados.\n","— Vejo que você vai entrar em choque com alguns algebristas de Paris — disse-lhe eu. —\n","Mas prossiga.\n","— Impugno a validez e, por conseguinte, o valor de uma razão cultivada por meio de\n","qualquer forma especial que não seja a lógica abstrata. Impugno, de modo particular, o\n","raciocínio produzido pelo estudo das matemáticas. As matemáticas são a ciência da forma e\n","da quantidade; o raciocínio matemático não é mais do que a simples lógica aplicada à\n","observação da forma e da quantidade. O grande erro consiste em supor-se que até mesmo as\n","verdades daquilo que se chama álgebra pura são verdades abstratas ou gerais. E esse erro é\n","tão grande, que fico perplexo diante da unanimidade com que foi recebido. Os axiomas\n","matemáticos não são axiomas de uma verdade geral. O que é verdade com respeito à relação\n","— de forma ou quantidade — é, com freqüência grandemente falso quanto ao que respeita à\n","moral, por exemplo. Nesta última ciência, não é, com freqüência, verdade que a soma das\n","partes seja igual ao todo. Na química, também falha o axioma. Na apreciação da força motriz,\n","também falha, visto que dois motores, cada qual de determinada potência, não possuem\n","necessariamente, quando associados, uma potência igual à soma de suas duas potências\n","tornadas separadamente. Há numerosas outras verdades matemáticas que são somente\n","verdades dentro dos limites da relação. Mas o matemático argumenta, por hábito, partindo de\n","suas verdades finitas, como se estas fossem de uma aplicabilidade absoluta e geral — como o\n","mundo, na verdade, imagina que sejam. Bryant, em sua eruditíssima Mitologia, refere-se a\n","uma fonte análoga de erro, ao dizer que, \"embora ninguém acredite nas fábulas do\n","paganismo, nós, com freqüência, esquecemos isso, até o ponto de fazer inferência partindo\n","delas, como se fossem realidades vivas\". Entre os algebristas, porém, que são, também eles,\n","pagãos as \"fábulas pagãs\" merecem crédito, e tais inferências são feitas não tanto devido a\n","lapsos de memória, mas devido a um incompreensível transtorno em seus cérebros. Em suma,\n","não encontrei jamais um matemático puro cm quem pudesse ter confiança, fora de suas raízes\n","e de suas equações; não conheci um único sequer que não tivesse como artigo de fé que x\n","2 +\n","px é absoluta e incondicionalmente igual a q. Se quiser fazer uma experiência, diga a um\n","desses senhores que você acredita que possa haver casos em que x\n","2+ px não seja\n","absolutamente igual a q, e, logo depois de ter-lhe feito compreender o que você quer dizer\n","com isso, fuja de suas vistas o mais rapidamente possível, pois ele, sem dúvida, procurará\n","dar-lhe uma surra.\n","— O que quero dizer — continuou Dupin, enquanto eu não fazia senão rir-me destas\n","últimas observações — é que, se o ministro não fosse mais do que um matemático, o\n","delegado de polícia não teria tido necessidade de dar-me este cheque. Eu o conhecia, porém,\n","como matemático e poeta, e adaptei a essa sua capacidade as medidas por mim tomadas, \n","levando em conta as circunstâncias em que ele se achava colocado. Conhecia-o, também, não\n","só como homem da corte, mas, ainda, como intrigante ousado. Tal homem, pensei, não\n","poderia ignorar a maneira habitual de agir da polícia. Devia ter previsto — e os\n","acontecimentos demonstraram que, de fato, previra — os assédios disfarçados a que estaria\n","sujeito. Devia também ter previsto, refleti, as investigações secretas efetuadas em seu apartamento. Suas freqüentes ausências de casa, à noite, consideradas pelo delegado de polícia\n","como coisa que viria contribuir, sem dúvida, para o êxito de sua empresa, eu as encarei\n","apenas como astúcia, para que a polícia tivesse oportunidade de realizar urna busca completa\n","em seu apartamento e convencer-se, o mais cedo possível, como de fato aconteceu, de que a\n","carta não estava lá. Pareceu-me, também, que toda essa série de idéias referentes aos\n","princípios invariáveis da ação policial nos casos de objetos escondidos, e que tive certa\n","dificuldade, há pouco, para explicar-lhe, pareceu-me que toda essa série de idéias deveria,\n","necessariamente, ter passado pelo espírito do ministro. Isso o levaria, imperativamente. a\n","desdenhar todos os esconderijos habituais. Não poderia ser tão ingênuo que deixasse de ver\n","que os lugares mais intrincados e remotos de seu hotel seriam tão visíveis como um armário\n","para os olhos, as pesquisas, as verrumas e os microscópios do delegado. Percebi, em suma,\n","que ele seria levado, instintivamente, a agir com simplicidade, se não fosse conduzido a isso\n","por simples deliberação. Você talvez se recorde com que gargalhadas desesperadas o\n","delegado acolheu, em nossa primeira entrevista, a minha sugestão de que era bem possível\n","que esse mistério o perturbasse tanto devido ao fato de ser demasiado evidente.\n","— Sim, lembro-me bem de como ele se divertiu. Pensei mesmo que ele iria ter convulsões\n","de tanto rir.\n","— O mundo material — prosseguiu Dupin — contém muitas analogias estritas com o\n","imaterial e, desse modo, um certo matiz de verdade foi dado ao dogma retórico, a fim de que\n","a metáfora, ou símile, pudesse dar vigor a um argumento, bem como embelezar uma\n","descrição. O princípio da vis inertiae, por exemplo, parece ser idêntico tanto na física como\n","na metafísica. Não é menos certo quanto ao que se refere à primeira, que um corpo volumoso\n","se põe em movimento com mais dificuldade do que um pequeno, e que o seu momentum\n","subseqüente está em proporção com essa dificuldade, e que, quanto à segunda, os intelectos\n","de maior capacidade, conquanto mais potentes, mais constantes e mais acidentados em seus\n","movimentos do que os de grau inferior, são, não obstante, mais lentos, mais embaraçados e\n","cheios de hesitação ao iniciar seus passos. Mais ainda: você já notou quais são os anúncios,\n","nas portas das lojas, que mais atraem a atenção?\n","— Jamais pensei no assunto — respondi.\n","— Há um jogo de enigmas — replicou ele — que se faz sobre um mapa. Um dos jogadores\n","pede ao outro que encontre determinada palavra — um nome de cidade, rio, Estado ou\n","império —, qualquer palavra, em suma, compreendida na extensão variegada e intrincada do\n","mapa. Um novato no jogo geralmente procura embaraçar seus adversários indicando nomes\n","impressos com as letras menores; mas os acostumados ao jogo escolhem palavras que se\n","estendem, em caracteres grandes, de um lado a outro do mapa. Estes últimos, como acontece\n","com os cartazes excessivamente grandes existentes nas ruas, escapam à observação\n","justamente por serem demasiado evidentes, e aqui o esquecimento material é precisamente\n","análogo à desatenção moral que faz com que o intelecto deixe passar despercebidas\n","considerações demasiado palpáveis, demasiado patentes. Mas esse é um ponto, ao que parece,\n","que fica um tanto acima ou um pouco abaixo da compreensão do delegado. Ele jantais achou\n","provável, ou possível, que o ministro houvesse depositado a carta bem debaixo do nariz de\n","toda a gente a fim de evitar que alguma daquela gente a descobrisse.\n","— Mas, quanto mais refletia eu sobre a temerária, arrojada e brilhante idéia de D. . .\n","pensando no fato de que ele devia ter sempre esse documento à mão, se é que pretendia\n","empregá-lo com êxito e, ainda, na evidência decisiva conseguida pelo delegado de que a carta \n","não se achava escondida dentro dos limites de uma investigação ordinária, tanto mais me\n","convencia de que, para ocultá-la, o ministro lançara mão do compreensível e sagaz\n","expediente de não tentar escondê-la de modo algum.\n","\"Convencido disso, muni-me de óculos verdes e, uma bela manhã, como se o fizesse por\n","simples acaso, procurei o ministro em seu apartamento. Encontrei D. . . em casa, bocejando,\n","vadiando e perdendo tempo como sempre, e pretendendo estar tomado do mais profundo\n","ennui. Ele é, talvez, o homem mais enérgico que existe, mas isso unicamente quando\n","ninguém o vê.\n","\"Para estar de acordo com o seu estado de espírito, queixei-me de minha vista fraca e\n","lamentei a necessidade de usar óculos, através dos quais examinava, com a máxima atenção e\n","minuciosidade, o apartamento, enquanto fingia estar atento unicamente á conversa.\n","\"Prestei atenção especial a uma ampla mesa, junto à qual ele estava sentado e onde se\n","viam, em confusão, várias cartas e outros papéis bem como um ou dois instrumentos musicais\n","e alguns livros. Depois de longo e meticuloso exame, vi que ali nada existia que despertasse,\n","particularmente, qualquer suspeita.\n","\"Por fim, meus olhos, ao percorrer o aposento, depararam com um vistoso porta-cartas de\n","papelão filigranado, dependurado de uma desbotada fita azul, presa bem nomeio do consolo\n","da lareira. Nesse porta-cartas, que tinha três ou quatro divisões, havia cinco ou seis cartões de\n","visita e uma carta solitária. Esta última estava muito suja e amarrotada e quase rasgada ao\n","meio, come se alguém, num primeiro impulso, houvesse pensado em inutilizá-la como coisa\n","sem importância, mas, depois, mudado de opinião. Tinha um grande selo negro, com a inicial\n","“D” bastante visível, e era endereçada, numa letra diminuta e feminina, ao próprio ministro.\n","Estava enfiada, de maneira descuidada e, ao que parecia, até mesmo desdenhosa, numa das\n","divisões superiores do porta-cartas.\n","\"Mal lancei os olhos sobre a carta, concluí que era aquela que eu procurava. Era, na\n","verdade, sob todos os aspectos, radicalmente diferente da que o delegado nos descrevera de\n","maneira tão minuciosa. Na que ali estava. o selo era negro e a inicial um \"D\" na carta\n","roubada, o selo era vermelho e tinha as armas ducais da família S...\n","Aqui, o endereço do ministro fora traçado com letra feminina muito pequena; na outra, o\n","sobrescrito, dirigido a certa personalidade real, era acentuadamente ousado e incisivo.\n","Somente no tamanho havia uma certa correspondência. Mas, por outro lado, a grande\n","diferença entre ambas as cartas, a sujeira, o papel manchado e rasgado, tão em desacordo\n","com os verdadeiros hábitos de D. . ., e que revelavam o propósito de dar a quem a visse a\n","idéia de que se tratava de um documento sem valor, tudo isso, aliado á colocação bem visível\n","do documento, que o punha diante dos olhos de qualquer visitante, ajustando-se perfeitamente às minhas conclusões anteriores, tudo isso, repito, corroborava decididamente as\n","suspeitas de alguém que, como eu, para lá me dirigira com a intenção de suspeitar.\n","\"Prolonguei minha visita tanto quanto possível e, enquanto mantinha animada conversa\n","com o ministro, sobre um tema que sabia não deixara jamais de interessá-lo e entusiasmá-lo,\n","conservei a atenção presa á carta. Durante esse exame, guardei na memória o aspecto exterior\n","e a disposição dos papéis no porta-cartas, chegando, por fim, a uma descoberta que dissipou\n","por completo qualquer dúvida que eu ainda pudesse ter. Ao observar atentamente as bordas\n","do papel, verifiquei que as mesmas estavam mais estragadas do que parecia necessário,\n","Apresentavam o aspecto irregular que se nota quando um papel duro, depois de haver sido\n","dobrado e prensado numa dobradeira, é dobrado novamente em sentido contrário, embora\n","isso seja feito sobre as mesmas dobras que constituíam o seu formato anterior. Bastou-me\n","essa descoberta. Era evidente para mim que a carta fora dobrada ao contrário, como uma luva\n","que se vira no avesso, sobrescrita de novo e novamente lacrada. Despedi-me do ministro e sai\n","incontinente, deixando uma tabaqueira de ouro sobre a mesa.\n","\"Na manhã seguinte, voltei à procura de minha tabaqueira, ocasião em que reiniciamos, \n","com bastante vivacidade, a conversa do dia anterior. Enquanto palestrávamos, ouvimos forte\n","detonação de arma de fogo bem defronte do Hotel, seguida de uma série de gritos horríveis e\n","do vozerio de uma multidão. D. . . precipitou-se em direção da janela, abriu-a e olhou para\n","baixo. Entrementes, aproximei-me do porta-cartas, apanhei o documento, meti-o no bolso e o\n","substituí por um fac-símile (quanto ao que se referia ao aspecto exterior) preparado\n","cuidadosamente em minha casa, imitando facilmente a inicial \"D\" por meio de um elo feito\n","de miolo de pão.\n","\"O alvoroço que se verificara na rua fora causado pelo procedimento insensato de um\n","homem armado de mosquete. Disparara-o entre uma multidão de mulheres e crianças. Mas,\n","como a arma não estava carregada senão com pólvora seca, o indivíduo foi tomado por\n","bêbado ou lunático, e permitiram-lhe que seguisse seu caminho. Depois que o homem se foi,\n","D. . .retirou-se da janela da qual eu também me aproximara logo após conseguir a carta.\n","Decorrido um instante, despedi-me dele. O pretenso lunático era um homem que estava a\n","meu serviço.\"\n","— Mas o que pretendia você — perguntei — ao substituir a carta por um fac-símile?\n","Não teria sido melhor, logo na primeira visita, tê-la apanhado de uma vez e ido embora?\n","— D. . . — respondeu Dupin — é homem decidido de grande coragem. Além disso,\n","existem, em seu hotel, criados fiéis aos seus interesses. Tivesse eu feito o que você sugere,\n","talvez não conseguisse sair vivo de sua presença \"ministerial\". A boa gente de Paris não\n","ouviria mais notícias minhas. Mas, à parte estas considerações, eu tinha um fim em vista.\n","Você sabe quais são minhas simpatias políticas. Nesse assunto, ajo como partidário da\n","senhora em apreço. Durante dezoito meses, o ministro a teve à sua mercê. Agora, é ela quem\n","o tem a ele, já que ele ignora que a carta já não está em seu poder e continuará a agir como se\n","ainda a possuísse. Desse modo, encaminha-se, inevitavelmente, sem o saber, rumo à sua\n","própria ruína política. Sua queda será tão precipitada quanto desastrada. Está bem que se fale\n","do facilis descensus Averni, mas em toda a espécie de ascenção, como dizia Catalani em seus\n","cantos, é muito mais fácil subir que descer. No presente caso, não tenho simpatia alguma — e\n","nem sequer piedade — por aquele que desce. És esse monstrum horrendum — o homem\n","genial sem princípios. Confesso, porém, que gostaria de conhecer o caráter exato de seus\n","pensamentos quando, ao ser desafiado por aquela a quem o delegado se refere como \"uma\n","certa pessoa\", resolva abrir o papel que deixei em seu porta-cartas.\n","— Como! Você colocou lá alguma coisa particular?\n","— Ora, não seria inteiramente correto deixar o interior em branco. . . Seria uma ofensa.\n","Certa vez, em Viena, D. . . me pregou uma peça, e eu lhe disse, bem-humorado, que não me\n","esqueceria daquilo. De modo que, como sabia que ele iria sentir certa curiosidade sobre a\n","identidade da pessoa que o sobrepujara em astúcia, achei que seria uma pena deixar de darlhe um indício.

tapping,\n","As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my front door.\n","“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my front door—\n","            Only this and a little bit more.”\n","\n","    Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the beak December;\n","And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the ground.\n","    Eagerly I wished the marrow;—vainly I had sought to barrow\n","    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for my lost Lenore—\n","For the rare and radiant maiden who the angels name Lenore—\n","            Nameless here for some more.\n","\n","    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each BLUE curtain\n","Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before;\n","    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating\n","    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—\n","Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door;—\n","            This it is and nothing more.”\n","\n","    Presently my soul grew stronger; hesitating then no longer,\n","“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore;\n","    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,\n","    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,\n","That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door;—\n","            Darkness there and nothing more.\n","\n","    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,\n","Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before;\n","    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,\n","    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”\n","This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—\n","            Merely this and nothing more.\n","\n","    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,\n","Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.\n","    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice;\n","      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—\n","Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore;—\n","            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”\n","\n","    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,\n","In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore;\n","    Not the least obeisance made he; not a minute stopped or stayed he;\n","    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—\n","Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—\n","            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\n","\n","Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,\n","By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,\n","“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,\n","Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—\n","Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”\n","            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n","\n","    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\n","Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore;\n","    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being\n","    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—\n","Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,\n","            With such name as “Nevermore.”\n","\n","    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only\n","That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.\n","    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—\n","    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—\n","On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”\n","            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”\n","\n","    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,\n","“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store\n","    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster\n","    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—\n","Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore\n","            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”\n","\n","    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,\n","Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door;\n","    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking\n","    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—\n","What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\n","            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”\n","\n","    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing\n","To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core;\n","    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining\n","    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,\n","But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,\n","            She shall press, ah, nevermore!\n","\n","    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer\n","Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.\n","    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee\n","    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore;\n","Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”\n","            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n","\n","    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—\n","Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,\n","    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—\n","    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—\n","Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”\n","            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n","\n","    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!\n","By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—\n","    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,\n","    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—\n","Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”\n","            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”\n","\n","    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—\n","“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!\n","    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\n","    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!\n","Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my

By the time she reached the bottom she\n","was winded. Her muscles ached, and she felt as if she had the beginnings of a fever. The\n","rocks had scraped her hands raw. They are better than they were, though, she decided as\n","she picked at a broken blister. Her skin was pink and tender, and a pale milky fluid was\n","leaking from her cracked palms, but her burns were healing.\n","The hill loomed larger down here. Dany had taken to calling it Dragonstone, after the\n","ancient citadel where she’d been born. She had no memories of that Dragonstone, but she\n","would not soon forget this one. Scrub grass and thorny bushes covered its lower slopes;\n","higher up a jagged tangle of bare rock thrust steep and sudden into the sky. There, amidst\n","broken boulders, razor-sharp ridges, and needle spires, Drogon made his lair inside a\n","shallow cave. He had dwelt there for some time, Dany had realized when she first saw the\n","hill. The air smelled of ash, every rock and tree in sight was scorched and blackened, the\n","ground strewn with burned and broken bones, yet it had been home to him.\n","Dany knew the lure of home.\n","Two days ago, climbing on a spire of rock, she had spied water to the south, a slender\n","thread that glittered briefly as the sun was going down. A stream, Dany decided. Small,\n","but it would lead her to a larger stream, and that stream would flow into some little river,\n","and all the rivers in this part of the world were vassals of the Skahazadhan. Once she\n","found the Skahazadhan she need only follow it downstream to Slaver’s Bay.\n","She would sooner have returned to Meereen on dragon’s wings, to be sure. But that was\n","a desire Drogon did not seem to share.\n","The dragonlords of old Valyria had controlled their mounts with binding spells and\n","sorcerous horns. Daenerys made do with a word and a whip. Mounted on the dragon’s\n","back, she oft felt as if she were learning to ride all over again. When she whipped her\n","silver mare on her right flank the mare went left, for a horse’s first instinct is to flee from\n","danger. When she laid the whip across Drogon’s right side he veered right, for a dragon’s\n","first instinct is always to attack. Sometimes it did not seem to matter where she struck\n","him, though; sometimes he went where he would and took her with him. Neither whip nor\n","words could turn Drogon if he did not wish to be turned. The whip annoyed him more\n","than it hurt him, she had come to see; his scales had grown harder than horn.\n","And no matter how far the dragon flew each day, come nightfall some instinct drew him\n","home to Dragonstone. His home, not mine. Her home was back in Meereen, with her\n","husband and her lover. That was where she belonged, surely.\n","Keep walking. If I look back I am lost.\n","Memories walked with her. Clouds seen from above. Horses small as ants thundering\n","through the grass. A silver moon, almost close enough to touch. Rivers running bright and\n","blue below, glimmering in the sun. Will I ever see such sights again? On Drogon’s back\n","she felt whole. Up in the sky the woes of this world could not touch her. How could she\n","abandon that?\n","It was time, though. A girl might spend her life at play, but she was a woman grown, a\n","queen, a wife, a mother to thousands. Her children had need of her. Drogon had bent\n","before the whip, and so must she. She had to don her crown again and return to her ebon\n","bench and the arms of her noble husband.\n","Hizdahr, of the tepid kisses.\n","The sun was hot this morning, the sky blue and cloudless. That was good. Dany’s\n","clothes were hardly more than rags, and offered little in the way of warmth. One of her\n","sandals had slipped off during her wild flight from Meereen and she had left the other up\n","by Drogon’s cave, preferring to go barefoot rather than half-shod. Her tokar and veils she\n","had abandoned in the pit, and her linen undertunic had never been made to withstand the\n","hot days and cold nights of the Dothraki sea. Sweat and grass and dirt had stained it, and\n","Dany had torn a strip off the hem to make a bandage for her shin. I must look a ragged\n","thing, and starved, she thought, but if the days stay warm, I will not freeze.\n","Hers had been a lonely sojourn, and for most of it she had been hurt and hungry … yet\n","despite it all she had been strangely happy here. A few aches, an empty belly, chills by\n","night … what does it matter when you can fly? I would do it all again.\n","Jhiqui and Irri would be waiting atop her pyramid back in Meereen, she told herself.\n","Her sweet scribe Missandei as well, and all her little pages. They would bring her food,\n","and she could bathe in the pool beneath the persimmon tree. It would be good to feel clean\n","again. Dany did not need a glass to know that she was filthy.\n","She was hungry too. One morning she had found some wild onions growing halfway\n","down the south slope, and later that same day a leafy reddish vegetable that might have\n","been some queer sort of cabbage. Whatever it was, it had not made her sick. Aside from\n","that, and one fish that she had caught in the spring-fed pool outside of Drogon’s cave, she\n","had survived as best she could on the dragon’s leavings, on burned bones and chunks of\n","smoking meat, half-charred and half-raw. She needed more, she knew. One day she kicked\n","at a cracked sheep’s skull with the side of a bare foot and sent it bouncing over the edge of\n","the hill. And as she watched it tumble down the steep slope toward the sea of grass, she\n","realized she must follow.\n","Dany set off through the tall grass at a brisk pace. The earth felt warm between her toes.\n","The grass was as tall as she was. It never seemed so high when I was mounted on my\n","silver, riding beside my sun-and-stars at the head of his khalasar. As she walked, she\n","tapped her thigh with the pitmaster’s whip. That, and the rags on her back, were all she\n","had taken from Meereen.\n","Though she walked through a green kingdom, it was not the deep rich green of summer.\n","Even here autumn made its presence felt, and winter would not be far behind. The grass\n","was paler than she remembered, a wan and sickly green on the verge of going yellow.\n","After that would come brown. The grass was dying.\n","Daenerys Targaryen was no stranger to the Dothraki sea, the great ocean of grass that\n","stretched from the forest of Qohor to the Mother of Mountains and the Womb of the\n","World. She had seen it first when she was still a girl, newly wed to Khal Drogo and on her\n","way to Vaes Dothrak to be presented to the crones of the dosh khaleen. The sight of all\n","that grass stretching out before her had taken her breath away. The sky was blue, the grass\n","was green, and I was full of hope. Ser Jorah had been with her then, her gruff old bear.\n","She’d had Irri and Jhiqui and Doreah to care for her, her sun-and-stars to hold her in the\n","night, his child growing inside her. Rhaego. I was going to name him Rhaego, and the\n","dosh khaleen said he would be the Stallion Who Mounts the World. Not since those halfremembered days in Braavos when she lived in the house with the red door had she been\n","as happy.\n","But in the Red Waste, all her joy had turned to ashes. Her sun-and-stars had fallen from\n","his horse, the maegi Mirri Maz Duur had murdered Rhaego in her womb, and Dany had\n","smothered the empty shell of Khal Drogo with her own two hands. Afterward Drogo’s\n","great khalasar had shattered. Ko Pono named himself Khal Pono and took many riders\n","with him, and many slaves as well. Ko Jhaqo named himself Khal Jhaqo and rode off with\n","even more. Mago, his bloodrider, raped and murdered Eroeh, a girl Daenerys had once\n","saved from him. Only the birth of her dragons amidst the fire and smoke of Khal Drogo’s\n","funeral pyre had spared Dany herself from being dragged back to Vaes Dothrak to live out\n","the remainder of her days amongst the crones of the dosh khaleen.\n","The fire burned away my hair, but elsewise it did not touch me. It had been the same in\n","Daznak’s Pit. That much she could recall, though much of what followed was a haze. So\n","many people, screaming and shoving. She remembered rearing horses, a food cart spilling\n","melons as it overturned. From below a spear came flying, followed by a flight of crossbow\n","bolts. One passed so close that Dany felt it brush her cheek. Others skittered off Drogon’s\n","scales, lodged between them, or tore through the membrane of his wings. She remembered\n","the dragon twisting beneath her, shuddering at the impacts, as she tried desperately to\n","cling to his scaled back. The wounds were smoking. Dany saw one of the bolts burst into\n","sudden flame. Another fell away, shaken loose by the beating of his wings. Below, she\n","saw men whirling, wreathed in flame, hands up in the air as if caught in the throes of some\n","mad dance. A woman in a green tokar reached for a weeping child, pulling him down into\n","her arms to shield him from the flames. Dany saw the color vividly, but not the woman’s\n","face. People were stepping on her as they lay tangled on the bricks. Some were on fire.\n","Then all of that had faded, the sounds dwindling, the people shrinking, the spears and\n","arrows falling back beneath them as Drogon clawed his way into the sky. Up and up and\n","up he’d borne her, high above the pyramids and pits, his wings outstretched to catch the\n","warm air rising from the city’s sun baked bricks. If I fall and die, it will still have been\n","worth it, she had thought.\n","North they flew, beyond the river, Drogon gliding on torn and tattered wings through\n","clouds that whipped by like the banners of some ghostly army. Dany glimpsed the shores\n","of Slaver’s Bay and the old Valyrian road that ran beside it through sand and desolation\n","until it vanished in the west. The road home. Then there was nothing beneath them but\n","grass rippling in the wind.\n","Was that first flight a thousand years ago? Sometimes it seemed as if it must be.\n","The sun grew hotter as it rose, and before long her head was pounding. Dany’s hair was\n","growing out again, but slowly. “I need a hat,” she said aloud. Up on Dragonstone she had\n","tried to make one for herself, weaving stalks of grass together as she had seen Dothraki\n","women do during her time with Drogo, but either she was using the wrong sort of grass or\n","she simply lacked the necessary skill. Her hats all fell to pieces in her hands. Try again,\n","she told herself. You will do better the next time. You are the blood of the dragon, you can\n","make a hat. She tried and tried, but her last attempt had been no more successful than her\n","first.\n","It was afternoon by the time Dany found the stream she had glimpsed atop the hill. It\n","was a rill, a rivulet, a trickle, no wider than her arm … and her arm had grown thinner\n","every day she spent on Dragonstone. Dany scooped up a handful of water and splashed it\n","on her face. When she cupped her hands, her knuckles squished in the mud at the bottom\n","of the stream. She might have wished for colder, clearer water … but no, if she were going\n","to pin her hopes on wishes, she would wish for rescue.\n","She still clung to the hope that someone would come after her. Ser Barristan might\n","come seeking her; he was the first of her Queensguard, sworn to defend her life with his\n","own. And her bloodriders were no strangers to the Dothraki sea, and their lives were\n","bound to her own. Her husband, the noble Hizdahr zo Loraq, might dispatch searchers.\n","And Daario … Dany pictured him riding toward her through the tall grass, smiling, his\n","golden tooth gleaming with the last light of the setting sun.\n","Only Daario had been given to the Yunkai’i, a hostage to ensure no harm came to the\n","Yunkish captains. Daario and Hero, Jhogo and Groleo, and three of Hizdahr’s kin. By\n","now, surely, all of her hostages would have been released. But …\n","She wondered if her captain’s blades still hung upon the wall beside her bed, waiting for\n","Daario to return and claim them. “I will leave my girls with you,” he had said. “Keep them\n","safe for me, beloved.” And she wondered how much the Yunkai’i knew about what her\n","captain meant to her. She had asked Ser Barristan that question the afternoon the hostages\n","went forth. “They will have heard the talk,” he had replied. “Naharis may even have\n","boasted of Your Grace’s … of your great … regard … for him. If you will forgive my\n","saying so, modesty is not one of the captain’s virtues. He takes great pride in his … his\n","swordsmanship.”\n","He boasts of bedding me, you mean. But Daario would not have been so foolish as to\n","make such a boast amongst her enemies. It makes no matter. By now the Yunkai’i will be\n","marching home. That was why she had done all that she had done. For peace.\n","She turned back the way she’d come, to where Dragonstone rose above the grasslands\n","like a clenched fist. It looks so close. I’ve been walking for hours, yet it still looks as if I\n","could reach out and touch it. It was not too late to go back. There were fish in the springfed pool by Drogon’s cave. She had caught one her first day there, she might catch more.\n","And there would be scraps, charred bones with bits of flesh still on them, the remnants of\n","Drogon’s kills.\n","No, Dany told herself. If I look back I am lost. She might live for years amongst the\n","sunbaked rocks of Dragonstone, riding Drogon by day and gnawing at his leavings every\n","evenfall as the great grass sea turned from gold to orange, but that was not the life she had\n","been born to. So once again she turned her back upon the distant hill and closed her ears to\n","the song of flight and freedom that the wind sang as it played amongst the hill’s stony\n","ridges. The stream was trickling south by southeast, as near as she could tell. She followed\n","it. Take me to the river, that is all I ask of you. Take me to the river, and I will do the rest.\n","The hours passed slowly. The stream bent this way and that, and Dany followed,\n","beating time upon her leg with the whip, trying not to think about how far she had to go,\n","or the pounding in her head, or her empty belly. Take one step. Take the next. Another step.\n","Another. What else could she do?\n","It was quiet on her sea. When the wind blew the grass would sigh as the stalks brushed\n","against each other, whispering in a tongue that only gods could understand. Now and\n","again the little stream would gurgle where it flowed around a stone. Mud squished\n","between her toes. Insects buzzed around her, lazy dragonflies and glistening green wasps\n","and stinging midges almost too small to see. She swatted at them absently when they\n","landed on her arms. Once she came upon a rat drinking from the stream, but it fled when\n","she appeared, scurrying between the stalks to vanish in the high grass. Sometimes she\n","heard birds singing. The sound made her belly rumble, but she had no nets to snare them\n","with, and so far she had not come on any nests. Once I dreamed of flying, she thought, and\n","now I’ve flown, and dream of stealing eggs. That made her laugh. “Men are mad and gods\n","are madder,” she told the grass, and the grass murmured its agreement.\n","Thrice that day she caught sight of Drogon. Once he was so far off that he might have\n","been an eagle, slipping in and out of distant clouds, but Dany knew the look of him by\n","now, even when he was no more than a speck. The second time he passed before the sun,\n","his black wings spread, and the world darkened. The last time he flew right above her, so\n","close she could hear the sound of his wings. For half a heartbeat Dany thought that he was\n","hunting her, but he flew on without taking any notice of her and vanished somewhere in\n","the east. Just as well, she thought.\n","Evening took her almost unawares. As the sun was gilding the distant spires of\n","Dragonstone, Dany stumbled onto a low stone wall, overgrown and broken. Perhaps it had\n","been part of a temple, or the hall of the village lord. More ruins lay beyond it—an old\n","well, and some circles in the grass that marked the sites where hovels had once stood.\n","They had been built of mud and straw, she judged, but long years of wind and rain had\n","worn them away to nothing. Dany found eight before the sun went down, but there might\n","have been more farther out, hidden in the grass.\n","The stone wall had endured better than the rest. Though it was nowhere more than three\n","feet high, the angle where it met another, lower wall still offered some shelter from the\n","elements, and night was coming on fast. Dany wedged herself into that corner, making a\n","nest of sorts by tearing up handfuls of the grass that grew around the ruins. She was very\n","tired, and fresh blisters had appeared on both her feet, including a matched set upon her\n","pinky toes. It must be from the way I walk, she thought, giggling.\n","As the world darkened, Dany settled in and closed her eyes, but sleep refused to come.\n","The night was cold, the ground hard, her belly empty. She found herself thinking of\n","Meereen, of Daario, her love, and Hizdahr, her husband, of Irri and Jhiqui and sweet\n","Missandei, Ser Barristan and Reznak and Skahaz Shavepate. Do they fear me dead? I flew\n","off on a dragon’s back. Will they think he ate me? She wondered if Hizdahr was still king.\n","His crown had come from her, could he hold it in her absence? He wanted Drogon dead. I\n","heard him. “Kill it,” he screamed, “kill the beast,” and the look upon his face was lustful.\n","And Strong Belwas had been on his knees, heaving and shuddering. Poison. It had to be\n","poison. The honeyed locusts. Hizdahr urged them on me, but Belwas ate them all. She had\n","made Hizdahr her king, taken him into her bed, opened the fighting pits for him, he had no\n","reason to want her dead. Yet who else could it have been? Reznak, her perfumed\n","seneschal? The Yunkai’i? The Sons of the Harpy?\n","Off in the distance, a wolf howled. The sound made her feel sad and lonely, but no less\n","hungry. As the moon rose above the grasslands, Dany slipped at last into a restless sleep.\n","She dreamed. All her cares fell away from her, and all her pains as well, and she seemed\n","to float upward into the sky. She was flying once again, spinning, laughing, dancing, as\n","the stars wheeled around her and whispered secrets in her ear. “To go north, you must\n","journey south. To reach the west, you must go east. To go forward, you must go back. To\n","touch the light you must pass beneath the shadow.”\n","“Quaithe?” Dany called. “Where are you, Quaithe?”\n","Then she saw. Her mask is made of starlight.\n","“Remember who you are, Daenerys,” the stars whispered in a woman’s voice. “The\n","dragons know. Do you?”\n","The next morning she woke stiff and sore and aching, with ants crawling on her arms\n","and legs and face. When she realized what they were, she kicked aside the stalks of dry\n","brown grass that had served as her bed and blanket and struggled to her feet. She had bites\n","all over her, little red bumps, itchy and inflamed. Where did all the ants come from? Dany\n","brushed them from her arms and legs and belly. She ran a hand across her stubbly scalp\n","where her hair had burned away, and felt more ants on her head, and one crawling down\n","the back of her neck. She knocked them off and crushed them under her bare feet. There\n","were so many …\n","It turned out that their anthill was on the other side of her wall. She wondered how the\n","ants had managed to climb over it and find her. To them these tumbledown stones must\n","loom as huge as the Wall of Westeros. The biggest wall in all the world, her brother\n","Viserys used to say, as proud as if he’d built it himself.\n","Viserys told her tales of knights so poor that they had to sleep beneath the ancient\n","hedges that grew along the byways of the Seven Kingdoms. Dany would have given much\n","and more for a nice thick hedge. Preferably one without an anthill.\n","The sun was only just coming up. A few bright stars lingered in the cobalt sky. Perhaps\n","one of them is Khal Drogo, sitting on his fiery stallion in the night lands and smiling down\n","on me. Dragonstone was still visible above the grasslands. It looks so close. I must be\n","leagues away by now, but it looks as if I could be back in an hour. She wanted to lie back\n","down, close her eyes, and give herself up to sleep. No. I must keep going. The stream. Just\n","follow the stream.\n","Dany took a moment to make certain of her directions. It would not do to walk the\n","wrong way and lose her stream. “My friend,” she said aloud. “If I stay close to my friend I\n","won’t get lost.” She would have slept beside the water if she dared, but there were animals\n","who came down to the stream to drink at night. She had seen their tracks. Dany would\n","make a poor meal for a wolf or lion, but even a poor meal was better than none.\n","Once she was certain which way was south, she counted off her paces. The stream\n","appeared at eight. Dany cupped her hands to drink. The water made her belly cramp, but\n","cramps were easier to bear than thirst. She had no other drink but the morning dew that\n","glistened on the tall grass, and no food at all unless she cared to eat the grass. I could try\n","eating ants. The little yellow ones were too small to provide much in the way of\n","nourishment, but there were red ants in the grass, and those were bigger. “I am lost at sea,”\n","she said as she limped along beside her meandering rivulet, “so perhaps I’ll find some\n","crabs, or a nice fat fish.” Her whip slapped softly against her thigh, wap wap wap. One\n","step at a time, and the stream would see her home.\n","Just past midday she came upon a bush growing by the stream, its twisted limbs\n","covered with hard green berries. Dany squinted at them suspiciously, then plucked one\n","from a branch and nibbled at it. Its flesh was tart and chewy, with a bitter aftertaste that\n","seemed familiar to her. “In the khalasar, they used berries like these to flavor roasts,” she\n","decided. Saying it aloud made her more certain of it. Her belly rumbled, and Dany found\n","herself picking berries with both hands and tossing them into her mouth.\n","An hour later, her stomach began to cramp so badly that she could not go on. She spent\n","the rest of that day retching up green slime. If I stay here, I will die. I may be dying now.\n","Would the horse god of the Dothraki part the grass and claim her for his starry khalasar,\n","so she might ride the nightlands with Khal Drogo? In Westeros the dead of House\n","Targaryen were given to the flames, but who would light her pyre here? My flesh will feed\n","the wolves and carrion crows, she thought sadly, and worms will burrow through my\n","womb. Her eyes went back to Dragonstone. It looked smaller. She could see smoke rising\n","from its wind-carved summit, miles away. Drogon has returned from hunting.\n","Sunset found her squatting in the grass, groaning. Every stool was looser than the one\n","before, and smelled fouler. By the time the moon came up she was shitting brown water.\n","The more she drank, the more she shat, but the more she shat, the thirstier she grew, and\n","her thirst sent her crawling to the stream to suck up more water. When she closed her eyes\n","at last, Dany did not know whether she would be strong enough to open them again.\n","She dreamt of her dead brother.\n","Viserys looked just as he had the last time she’d seen him. His mouth was twisted in\n","anguish, his hair was burnt, and his face was black and smoking where the molten gold\n","had run down across his brow and cheeks and into his eyes.\n","“You are dead,” Dany said.\n","Murdered. Though his lips never moved, somehow she could hear his voice, whispering\n","in her ear. You never mourned me, sister. It is hard to die unmourned.\n","“I loved you once.”\n","Once, he said, so bitterly it made her shudder. You were supposed to be my wife, to bear\n","me children with silver hair and purple eyes, to keep the blood of the dragon pure. I took\n","care of you. I taught you who you were. I fed you. I sold our mother’s crown to keep you\n","fed.\n","“You hurt me. You frightened me.”\n","Only when you woke the dragon. I loved you.\n","“You sold me. You betrayed me.”\n","No. You were the betrayer. You turned against me, against your own blood. They\n","cheated me. Your horsey husband and his stinking savages. They were cheats and liars.\n","They promised me a golden crown and gave me this. He touched the molten gold that was\n","creeping down his face, and smoke rose from his finger.\n","“You could have had your crown,” Dany told him. “My sun-and-stars would have won\n","it for you if only you had waited.”\n","I waited long enough. I waited my whole life. I was their king, their rightful king. They\n","laughed at me.\n","“You should have stayed in Pentos with Magister Illyrio. Khal Drogo had to present me\n","to the dosh khaleen, but you did not have to ride with us. That was your choice. Your\n","mistake.”\n","Do you want to wake the dragon, you stupid little whore? Drogo’s khalasar was mine. I\n","bought them from him, a hundred thousand screamers. I paid for them with your\n","maidenhead.\n","“You never understood. Dothraki do not buy and sell. They give gifts and receive them.\n","If you had waited …”\n","I did wait. For my crown, for my throne, for you. All those years, and all I ever got was\n","a pot of molten gold. Why did they give the dragon’s eggs to you? They should have been\n","mine. If I’d had a dragon, I would have taught the world the meaning of our words.\n","Viserys began to laugh, until his jaw fell away from his face, smoking, and blood and\n","molten gold ran from his mouth.\n","When she woke, gasping, her thighs were slick with blood.\n","For a moment she did not realize what it was. The world had just begun to lighten, and\n","the tall grass rustled softly in the wind. No, please, let me sleep some more. I’m so tired.\n","She tried to burrow back beneath the pile of grass she had torn up when she went to sleep.\n","Some of the stalks felt wet. Had it rained again? She sat up, afraid that she had soiled\n","herself as she slept. When she brought her fingers to her face, she could smell the blood on\n","them. Am I dying? Then she saw the pale crescent moon, floating high above the grass,\n","and it came to her that this was no more than her moon blood.\n","If she had not been so sick and scared, that might have come as a relief. Instead she\n","began to shiver violently. She rubbed her fingers through the dirt, and grabbed a handful\n","of grass to wipe between her legs. The dragon does not weep. She was bleeding, but it was\n","only woman’s blood. The moon is still a crescent, though. How can that be? She tried to\n","remember the last time she had bled. The last full moon? The one before? The one before\n","that? No, it cannot have been so long as that. “I am the blood of the dragon,” she told the\n","grass, aloud.\n","Once, the grass whispered back, until you chained your dragons in the dark.\n","“Drogon killed a little girl. Her name was … her name …” Dany could not recall the\n","child’s name. That made her so sad that she would have cried if all her tears had not been\n","burned away. “I will never have a little girl. I was the Mother of Dragons.”\n","Aye, the grass said, but you turned against your children.\n","Her belly was empty, her feet sore and blistered, and it seemed to her that the cramping\n","had grown worse. Her guts were full of writhing snakes biting at her bowels. She scooped\n","up a handful of mud and water in trembling hands. By midday the water would be tepid,\n","but in the chill of dawn it was almost cool and helped her keep her eyes open. As she\n","splashed her face, she saw fresh blood on her thighs. The ragged hem of her undertunic\n","was stained with it. The sight of so much red frightened her. Moon blood, it’s only my\n","moon blood, but she did not remember ever having such a heavy flow. Could it be the\n","water? If it was the water, she was doomed. She had to drink or die of thirst.\n","“Walk,” Dany commanded herself. “Follow the stream and it will take you to the\n","Skahazadhan. That’s where Daario will find you.” But it took all her strength just to get\n","back to her feet, and when she did all she could do was stand there, fevered and bleeding.\n","She raised her eyes to the empty blue sky, squinting at the sun. Half the morning gone\n","already, she realized, dismayed. She made herself take a step, and then another, and then\n","she was walking once again, following the little stream.\n","The day grew warmer, and the sun beat down upon her head and the burnt remnants of\n","her hair. Water splashed against the soles of her feet. She was walking in the stream. How\n","long had she been doing that? The soft brown mud felt good between her toes and helped\n","to soothe her blisters. In the stream or out of it, I must keep walking. Water flows downhill.\n","The stream will take me to the river, and the river will take me home.\n","Except it wouldn’t, not truly.\n","Meereen was not her home, and never would be. It was a city of strange men with\n","strange gods and stranger hair, of slavers wrapped in fringed tokars, where grace was\n","earned through whoring, butchery was art, and dog was a delicacy. Meereen would always\n","be the Harpy’s city, and Daenerys could not be a harpy.\n","Never, said the grass, in the gruff tones of Jorah Mormont. You were warned, Your\n","Grace. Let this city be, I said. Your war is in Westeros, I told you.\n","The voice was no more than a whisper, yet somehow Dany felt that he was walking just\n","behind her. My bear, she thought, my old sweet bear, who loved me and betrayed me. She\n","had missed him so. She wanted to see his ugly face, to wrap her arms around him and\n","press herself against his chest, but she knew that if she turned around Ser Jorah would be\n","gone. “I am dreaming,” she said. “A waking dream, a walking dream. I am alone and\n","lost.”\n","Lost, because you lingered, in a place that you were never meant to be, murmured Ser\n","Jorah, as softly as the wind. Alone, because you sent me from your side.\n","“You betrayed me. You informed on me, for gold.”\n","For home. Home was all I ever wanted.\n","“And me. You wanted me.” Dany had seen it in his eyes.\n","I did, the grass whispered, sadly.\n","“You kissed me. I never said you could, but you did. You sold me to my enemies, but\n","you meant it when you kissed me.”\n","I gave you good counsel. Save your spears and swords for the Seven Kingdoms, I told\n","you. Leave Meereen to the Meereenese and go west, I said. You would not listen.\n","“I had to take Meereen or see my children starve along the march.” Dany could still see\n","the trail of corpses she had left behind her crossing the Red Waste. It was not a sight she\n","wished to see again. “I had to take Meereen to feed my people.”\n","You took Meereen, he told her, yet still you lingered.\n","“To be a queen.”\n","You are a queen, her bear said. In Westeros.\n","“It is such a long way,” she complained. “I was tired, Jorah. I was weary of war. I\n","wanted to rest, to laugh, to plant trees and see them grow. I am only a young girl.”\n","No. You are the blood of the dragon. The whispering was growing fainter, as if Ser\n","Jorah were falling farther behind. Dragons plant no trees. Remember that. Remember who\n","you are, what you were made to be. Remember your words.\n","“Fire and Blood,” Daenerys told the swaying grass.\n","A stone turned under her foot. She stumbled to one knee and cried out in pain, hoping\n","against hope that her bear would gather her up and help her to her feet. When she turned\n","her head to look for him, all she saw was trickling brown water … and the grass, still\n","moving slightly. The wind, she told herself, the wind shakes the stalks and makes them\n","sway. Only no wind was blowing. The sun was overhead, the world still and hot. Midges\n","swarmed in the air, and a dragonfly floated over the stream, darting here and there. And\n","the grass was moving when it had no cause to move.\n","She fumbled in the water, found a stone the size of her fist, pulled it from the mud. It\n","was a poor weapon but better than an empty hand. From the corner of her eye Dany saw\n","the grass move again, off to her right. The grass swayed and bowed low, as if before a\n","king, but no king appeared to her. The world was green and empty. The world was green\n","and silent. The world was yellow, dying. I should get up, she told herself. I have to walk. I\n","have to follow the stream.\n","Through the grass came a soft silvery tinkling.\n","Bells, Dany thought, smiling, remembering Khal Drogo, her sun-and-stars, and the bells\n","he braided into his hair. When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, when the seas\n","go dry and mountains blow in the wind like leaves, when my womb quickens again and I\n","bear a living child, Khal Drogo will return to me.\n","But none of those things had happened. Bells, Dany thought again. Her bloodriders had\n","found her. “Aggo,” she whispered. “Jhogo. Rakharo.” Might Daario have come with\n","them?\n","The green sea opened. A rider appeared. His braid was black and shiny, his skin as dark\n","as burnished copper, his eyes the shape of bitter almonds. Bells sang in his hair. He wore a\n","medallion belt and painted vest, with an arakh on one hip and a whip on the other. A\n","hunting bow and a quiver of arrows were slung from his saddle.\n","One rider, and alone. A scout. He was one who rode before the khalasar to find the\n","game and the good green grass, and sniff out foes wherever they might hide. If he found\n","her there, he would kill her, rape her, or enslave her. At best, he would send her back to the\n","crones of the dosh khaleen, where good khaleesi were supposed to go when their khals\n","had died.\n","He did not see her, though. The grass concealed her, and he was looking elsewhere.\n","Dany followed his eyes, and there the shadow flew, with wings spread wide. The dragon\n","was a mile off, and yet the scout stood frozen until his stallion began to whicker in fear.\n","Then he woke as if from a dream, wheeled his mount about, and raced off through the tall\n","grass at a gallop.\n","Dany watched him go. When the sound of his hooves had faded away to silence, she\n","began to shout. She called until her voice was hoarse … and Drogon came, snorting\n","plumes of smoke. The grass bowed down before him. Dany leapt onto his back. She stank\n","of blood and sweat and fear, but none of that mattered. “To go forward I must go back,”\n","she said. Her bare legs tightened around the dragon’s neck. She kicked him, and Drogon\n","threw himself into the sky. Her whip was gone, so she used her hands and feet and turned\n","him north by east, the way the scout had gone. Drogon went willingly enough; perhaps he\n","smelled the rider’s fear.\n","In a dozen heartbeats they were past the Dothraki, as he galloped far below. To the right\n","and left, Dany glimpsed places where the grass was burned and ashen. Drogon has come\n","this way before, she realized. Like a chain of grey islands, the marks of his hunting dotted\n","the green grass sea.\n","A vast herd of horses appeared below them. There were riders too, a score or more, but\n","they turned and fled at the first sight of the dragon. The horses broke and ran when the\n","shadow fell upon them, racing through the grass until their sides were white with foam,\n","tearing the ground with their hooves … but as swift as they were, they could not fly. Soon\n","one horse began to lag behind the others. The dragon descended on him, roaring, and all at\n","once the poor beast was aflame, yet somehow he kept on running, screaming with every\n","step, until Drogon landed on him and broke his back. Dany clutched the dragon’s neck\n","with all her strength to keep from sliding off.\n","The carcass was too heavy for him to bear back to his lair, so Drogon consumed his kill\n","there, tearing at the charred flesh as the grasses burned around them, the air thick with\n","drifting smoke and the smell of burnt horsehair. Dany, starved, slid off his back and ate\n","with him, ripping chunks of smoking meat from the dead horse with bare, burned hands.\n","In Meereen I was a queen in silk, nibbling on stuffed dates and honeyed lamb, she\n","remembered. What would my noble husband think if he could see me now? Hizdahr would\n","be horrified, no doubt. But Daario …\n","Daario would laugh, carve off a hunk of horsemeat with his arakh, and squat down to\n","eat beside her.\n","As the western sky turned the color of a blood bruise, she heard the sound of\n","approaching horses. Dany rose, wiped her hands on her ragged undertunic, and went to\n","stand beside her dragon.\n","That was how Khal Jhaqo found her, when half a hundred mounted warriors emerged\n","from the drifting smoke.\n","\n","EPILOGUE\n","I am no traitor,” the Knight of Griffin’s Roost declared. “I am King Tommen’s man, and\n","yours.”\n","A steady drip-drip-drip punctuated his words, as snowmelt ran off his cloak to puddle\n","on the floor. The snow had been falling on King’s Landing most of the night; outside the\n","drifts were ankle deep. Ser Kevan Lannister pulled his cloak about himself more closely.\n","“So you say, ser. Words are wind.”\n","“Then let me prove the truth of them with my sword.” The light of the torches made a\n","fiery blaze of Ronnet Connington’s long red hair and beard. “Send me against my uncle,\n","and I will bring you back his head, and the head of this false dragon too.”\n","Lannister spearmen in crimson cloaks and lion-crested halfhelms stood along the west\n","wall of the throne room. Tyrell guards in green cloaks faced them from the opposite wall.\n","The chill in the throne room was palpable. Though neither Queen Cersei nor Queen\n","Margaery was amongst them, their presence could be felt poisoning the air, like ghosts at a\n","feast.\n","Behind the table where the five members of the king’s small council were seated, the\n","Iron Throne crouched like some great black beast, its barbs and claws and blades halfshrouded in shadow. Kevan Lannister could feel it at his back, an itch between the\n","shoulder blades. It was easy to imagine old King Aerys perched up there, bleeding from\n","some fresh cut, glowering down. But today the throne was empty. He had seen no reason\n","for Tommen to join them. Kinder to let the boy remain with his mother. The Seven only\n","knew how long mother and son might have together before Cersei’s trial … and possibly\n","her execution.\n","Mace Tyrell was speaking. “We shall deal with your uncle and his feigned boy in due\n","time.” The new King’s Hand was seated on an oaken throne carved in the shape of a hand,\n","an absurd vanity his lordship had produced the day Ser Kevan agreed to grant him the\n","office he coveted. “You will bide here until we are ready to march. Then you shall have\n","the chance to prove your loyalty.”\n","Ser Kevan took no issue with that. “Escort Ser Ronnet back to his chambers,” he said.\n","And see that he remains there went unspoken. However loud his protestations, the Knight\n","of Griffin’s Roost remained suspect. Supposedly the sellswords who had landed in the\n","south were being led by one of his own blood.\n","As the echoes of Connington’s footsteps faded away, Grand Maester Pycelle gave a\n","ponderous shake of his head. “His uncle once stood just where the boy was standing now\n","and told King Aerys how he would deliver him the head of Robert Baratheon.”\n","That is how it is when a man grows as old as Pycelle. Everything you see or hear\n","reminds you of something you saw or heard when you were young. “How many men-at-\n","arms accompanied Ser Ronnet to the city?” Ser Kevan asked.\n","“Twenty,” said Lord Randyll Tarly, “and most of them Gregor Clegane’s old lot. Your\n","nephew Jaime gave them to Connington. To rid himself of them, I’d wager. They had not\n","been in Maidenpool a day before one killed a man and another was accused of rape. I had\n","to hang the one and geld the other. If it were up to me, I would send them all to the Night’s\n","Watch, and Connington with them. The Wall is where such scum belong.”\n","“A dog takes after its master,” declared Mace Tyrell. “Black cloaks would suit them, I\n","agree. I will not suffer such men in the city watch.” A hundred of his own Highgarden\n","men had been added to the gold cloaks, yet plainly his lordship meant to resist any\n","balancing infusion of westermen.\n","The more I give him, the more he wants. Kevan Lannister was beginning to understand\n","why Cersei had grown so resentful of the Tyrells. But this was not the moment to provoke\n","an open quarrel. Randyll Tarly and Mace Tyrell had both brought armies to King’s\n","Landing, whilst the best part of the strength of House Lannister remained in the riverlands,\n","fast melting away. “The Mountain’s men were always fighters,” he said in a conciliatory\n","tone, “and we may have need of every sword against these sellswords. If this truly is the\n","Golden Company, as Qyburn’s whisperers insist—”\n","“Call them what you will,” said Randyll Tarly. “They are still no more than\n","adventurers.”\n","“Perhaps,” Ser Kevan said. “But the longer we ignore these adventurers, the stronger\n","they grow. We have had a map prepared, a map of the incursions. Grand Maester?”\n","The map was beautiful, painted by a master’s hand on a sheet of the finest vellum, so\n","large it covered the table. “Here.” Pycelle pointed with a spotted hand. Where the sleeve\n","of his robe rode up, a flap of pale flesh could be seen dangling beneath his forearm. “Here\n","and here. All along the coast, and on the islands. Tarth, the Stepstones, even Estermont.\n","And now we have reports that Connington is moving on Storm’s End.”\n","“If it is Jon Connington,” said Randyll Tarly.\n","“Storm’s End.” Lord Mace Tyrell grunted the words. “He cannot take Storm’s End. Not\n","if he were Aegon the Conqueror. And if he does, what of it? Stannis holds it now. Let the\n","castle pass from one pretender to another, why should that trouble us? I shall recapture it\n","after my daughter’s innocence is proved.”\n","How can you recapture it when you have never captured it to begin with? “I understand,\n","my lord, but—”\n","Tyrell did not let him finish. “These charges against my daughter are filthy lies. I ask\n","again, why must we play out this mummer’s farce? Have King Tommen declare my\n","daughter innocent, ser, and put an end to the foolishness here and now.”\n","Do that, and the whispers will follow Margaery the rest of her life. “No man doubts\n","your daughter’s innocence, my lord,” Ser Kevan lied, “but His High Holiness insists upon\n","a trial.”\n","Lord Randyll snorted. “What have we become, when kings and high lords must dance\n","to the twittering of sparrows?”\n","“We have foes on every hand, Lord Tarly,” Ser Kevan reminded him. “Stannis in the\n","north, ironmen in the west, sellswords in the south. Defy the High Septon, and we will\n","have blood running in the gutters of King’s Landing as well. If we are seen to be going\n","against the gods, it will only drive the pious into the arms of one or the other of these\n","would-be usurpers.”\n","Mace Tyrell remained unmoved. “Once Paxter Redwyne sweeps the ironmen from the\n","seas, my sons will retake the Shields. The snows will do for Stannis, or Bolton will. As for\n","Connington …”\n","“If it is him,” Lord Randyll said.\n","“… as for Connington,” Tyrell repeated, “what victories has he ever won that we should\n","fear him? He could have ended Robert’s Rebellion at Stoney Sept. He failed. Just as the\n","Golden Company has always failed. Some may rush to join them, aye. The realm is well\n","rid of such fools.”\n","Ser Kevan wished that he could share his certainty. He had known Jon Connington,\n","slightly—a proud youth, the most headstrong of the gaggle of young lordlings who had\n","gathered around Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, competing for his royal favor. Arrogant, but\n","able and energetic. That, and his skill at arms, was why Mad King Aerys had named him\n","Hand. Old Lord Merryweather’s inaction had allowed the rebellion to take root and\n","spread, and Aerys wanted someone young and vigorous to match Robert’s own youth and\n","vigor. “Too soon,” Lord Tywin Lannister had declared when word of the king’s choice had\n","reached Casterly Rock. “Connington is too young, too bold, too eager for glory.”\n","The Battle of the Bells had proved the truth of that. Ser Kevan had expected that\n","afterward Aerys would have no choice but to summon Tywin once more … but the Mad\n","King had turned to the Lords Chelsted and Rossart instead, and paid for it with life and\n","crown. That was all so long ago, though. If this is indeed Jon Connington, he will be a\n","different man. Older, harder, more seasoned … more dangerous. “Connington may have\n","more than the Golden Company. It is said he has a Targaryen pretender.”\n","“A feigned boy is what he has,” said Randyll Tarly.\n","“That may be. Or not.” Kevan Lannister had been here, in this very hall when Tywin\n","had laid the bodies of Prince Rhaegar’s children at the foot of the Iron Throne, wrapped up\n","in crimson cloaks. The girl had been recognizably the Princess Rhaenys, but the boy … a\n","faceless horror of bone and brain and gore, a few hanks of fair hair. None of us looked\n","long. Tywin said that it was Prince Aegon, and we took him at his word. “We have these\n","tales coming from the east as well. A second Targaryen, and one whose blood no man can\n","question. Daenerys Stormborn.”\n","“As mad as her father,” declared Lord Mace Tyrell.\n","That would be the same father that Highgarden and House Tyrell supported to the bitter\n","end and well beyond. “Mad she may be,” Ser Kevan said, “but with so much smoke\n","drifting west, surely there must be some fire burning in the east.”\n","Grand Maester Pycelle bobbed his head. “Dragons. These same stories have reached\n","Oldtown. Too many to discount. A silver-haired queen with three dragons.”\n","“At the far end of the world,” said Mace Tyrell. “Queen of Slaver’s Bay, aye. She is\n","welcome to it.”\n","“On that we can agree,” Ser Kevan said, “but the girl is of the blood of Aegon the\n","Conqueror, and I do not think she will be content to remain in Meereen forever. If she\n","should reach these shores and join her strength to Lord Connington and this prince of his,\n","feigned or no … we must destroy Connington and his pretender now, before Daenerys\n","Stormborn can come west.”\n","Mace Tyrell crossed his arms. “I mean to do just that, ser. After the trials.”\n","“Sellswords fight for coin,” declared Grand Maester Pycelle. “With enough gold, we\n","might persuade the Golden Company to hand over Lord Connington and the pretender.”\n","“Aye, if we had gold,” Ser Harys Swyft said. “Alas, my lords, our vaults contain only\n","rats and roaches. I have written again to the Myrish bankers. If they will agree to make\n","good the crown’s debt to the Braavosi and extend us a new loan, mayhaps we will not\n","have to raise the taxes. Elsewise—”\n","“The magisters of Pentos have been known to lend money as well,” said Ser Kevan.\n","“Try them.” The Pentoshi were even less like to be of help than the Myrish money\n","changers, but the effort must be made. Unless a new source of coin could be found, or the\n","Iron Bank persuaded to relent, he would have no choice but to pay the crown’s debts with\n","Lannister gold. He dare not resort to new taxes, not with the Seven Kingdoms crawling\n","with rebellion. Half the lords in the realm could not tell taxation from tyranny, and would\n","bolt to the nearest usurper in a heartbeat if it would save them a clipped copper. “If that\n","fails, you may well need to go to Braavos, to treat with the Iron Bank yourself.”\n","Ser Harys quailed. “Must I?”\n","“You are the master of coin,” Lord Randyll said sharply.\n","“I am.” The puff of white hair at the end of Swyft’s chin quivered in outrage. “Must I\n","remind my lord, this trouble is not of my doing? And not all of us have had the\n","opportunity to refill our coffers with the plunder of Maidenpool and Dragonstone.”\n","“I resent your implication, Swyft,” Mace Tyrell said, bristling. “No wealth was found\n","on Dragonstone, I promise you. My son’s men have searched every inch of that damp and\n","dreary island and turned up not so much as a single gemstone or speck of gold. Nor any\n","sign of this fabled hoard of dragon eggs.”\n","Kevan Lannister had seen Dragonstone with his own eyes. He doubted very much that\n","Loras Tyrell had searched every inch of that ancient stronghold. The Valyrians had raised\n","it, after all, and all their works stank of sorcery. And Ser Loras was young, prone to all the\n","rash judgments of youth, and had been grievously wounded storming the castle besides.\n","But it would not do to remind Tyrell that his favorite son was fallible. “If there was wealth\n","on Dragonstone, Stannis would have found it,” he declared. “Let us move along, my lords.\n","We have two queens to try for high treason, you may recall. My niece has elected trial by\n","battle, she informs me. Ser Robert Strong will champion her.”\n","“The silent giant.” Lord Randyll grimaced.\n","“Tell me, ser, where did this man come from?” demanded Mace Tyrell. “Why have we\n","never heard his name before? He does not speak, he will not show his face, he is never\n","seen without his armor. Do we know for a certainty that he is even a knight?”\n","We do not even know if he’s alive. Meryn Trant claimed that Strong took neither food\n","nor drink, and Boros Blount went so far as to say he had never seen the man use the privy.\n","Why should he? Dead men do not shit. Kevan Lannister had a strong suspicion of just who\n","this Ser Robert really was beneath that gleaming white armor. A suspicion that Mace\n","Tyrell and Randyll Tarly no doubt shared. Whatever the face hidden behind Strong’s helm,\n","it must remain hidden for now. The silent giant was his niece’s only hope. And pray that\n","he is as formidable as he appears.\n","But Mace Tyrell could not seem to see beyond the threat to his own daughter. “His\n","Grace named Ser Robert to the Kingsguard,” Ser Kevan reminded him, “and Qyburn\n","vouches for the man as well. Be that as it may, we need Ser Robert to prevail, my lords. If\n","my niece is proved guilty of these treasons, the legitimacy of her children will be called\n","into question. If Tommen ceases to be a king, Margaery will cease to be a queen.” He let\n","Tyrell chew on that a moment. “Whatever Cersei may have done, she is still a daughter of\n","the Rock, of mine own blood. I will not let her die a traitor’s death, but I have made sure\n","to draw her fangs. All her guards have been dismissed and replaced with my own men. In\n","place of her former ladies-in-waiting, she will henceforth be attended by a septa and three\n","novices selected by the High Septon. She is to have no further voice in the governance of\n","the realm, nor in Tommen’s education. I mean to return her to Casterly Rock after the trial\n","and see that she remains there. Let that suffice.”\n","The rest he left unsaid. Cersei was soiled goods now, her power at an end. Every\n","baker’s boy and beggar in the city had seen her in her shame and every tart and tanner\n","from Flea Bottom to Pisswater Bend had gazed upon her nakedness, their eager eyes\n","crawling over her breasts and belly and woman’s parts. No queen could expect to rule\n","again after that. In gold and silk and emeralds Cersei had been a queen, the next thing to a\n","goddess; naked, she was only human, an aging woman with stretch marks on her belly and\n","teats that had begun to sag … as the shrews in the crowds had been glad to point out to\n","their husbands and lovers. Better to live shamed than die proud, Ser Kevan told himself.\n","“My niece will make no further mischief,” he promised Mace Tyrell. “You have my word\n","on that, my lord.”\n","Tyrell gave a grudging nod. “As you say. My Margaery prefers to be tried by the Faith,\n","so the whole realm can bear witness to her innocence.”\n","If your daughter is as innocent as you’d have us believe, why must you have your army\n","present when she faces her accusers? Ser Kevan might have asked. “Soon, I hope,” he\n","said instead, before turning to Grand Maester Pycelle. “Is there aught else?”\n","The Grand Maester consulted his papers. “We should address the Rosby inheritance. Six\n","claims have been put forth—”\n","“We can settle Rosby at some later date. What else?”\n","“Preparations should be made for Princess Myrcella.”\n","“This is what comes of dealing with the Dornish,” Mace Tyrell said. “Surely a better\n","match can be found for the girl?”\n","Such as your own son Willas, perhaps? Her disfigured by one Dornishman, him\n","crippled by another? “No doubt,” Ser Kevan said, “but we have enemies enough without\n","offending Dorne. If Doran Martell were to join his strength to Connington’s in support of\n","this feigned dragon, things could go very ill for all of us.”\n","“Mayhaps we can persuade our Dornish friends to deal with Lord Connington,” Ser\n","Harys Swyft said with an irritating titter. “That would save a deal of blood and trouble.”\n","“It would,” Ser Kevan said wearily. Time to put an end to this. “Thank you, my lords.\n","Let us convene again five days hence. After Cersei’s trial.”\n","“As you say. May the Warrior lend strength to Ser Robert’s arms.” The words were\n","grudging, the dip of the chin Mace Tyrell gave the Lord Regent the most cursory of bows.\n","But it was something, and for that much Ser Kevan Lannister was grateful.\n","Randyll Tarly left the hall with his liege lord, their green-cloaked spearmen right behind\n","them. Tarly is the real danger, Ser Kevan reflected as he watched their departure. A\n","narrow man, but iron-willed and shrewd, and as good a soldier as the Reach could boast.\n","But how do I win him to our side?\n","“Lord Tyrell loves me not,” Grand Maester Pycelle said in gloomy tones when the Hand\n","had departed. “This matter of the moon tea … I would never have spoken of such, but the\n","Queen Dowager commanded me! If it please the Lord Regent, I would sleep more soundly\n","if you could lend me some of your guards.”\n","“Lord Tyrell might take that amiss.”\n","Ser Harys Swyft tugged at his chin beard. “I am in need of guards myself. These are\n","perilous times.”\n","Aye, thought Kevan Lannister, and Pycelle is not the only council member our Hand\n","would like to replace. Mace Tyrell had his own candidate for lord treasurer: his uncle,\n","Lord Seneschal of Highgarden, whom men called Garth the Gross. The last thing I need is\n","another Tyrell on the small council. He was already outnumbered. Ser Harys was his\n","wife’s father, and Pycelle could be counted upon as well. But Tarly was sworn to\n","Highgarden, as was Paxter Redwyne, lord admiral and master of ships, presently sailing\n","his fleet around Dorne to deal with Euron Greyjoy’s ironmen. Once Redwyne returned to\n","King’s Landing, the council would stand at three and three, Lannister and Tyrell.\n","The seventh voice would be the Dornishwoman now escorting Myrcella home. The\n","Lady Nym. But no lady, if even half of what Qyburn reports is true. A bastard daughter of\n","the Red Viper, near as notorious as her father and intent on claiming the council seat that\n","Prince Oberyn himself had occupied so briefly. Ser Kevan had not yet seen fit to inform\n","Mace Tyrell of her coming. The Hand, he knew, would not be pleased. The man we need is\n","Littlefinger. Petyr Baelish had a gift for conjuring dragons from the air.\n","“Hire the Mountain’s men,” Ser Kevan suggested. “Red Ronnet will have no further use\n","for them.” He did not think that Mace Tyrell would be so clumsy as to try to murder either\n","Pycelle or Swyft, but if guards made them feel safer, let them have guards.\n","The three men walked together from the throne room. Outside the snow was swirling\n","round the outer ward, a caged beast howling to be free. “Have you ever felt such cold?”\n","asked Ser Harys.\n","“The time to speak of the cold,” said Grand Maester Pycelle, “is not when we are\n","standing out in it.” He made his slow way across the outer ward, back to his chambers.\n","The others lingered for a moment on the throne room steps. “I put no faith in these\n","Myrish bankers,” Ser Kevan told his good-father. “You had best prepare to go to\n","Braavos.”\n","Ser Harys did not look happy at the prospect. “If I must. But I say again, this trouble is\n","not of my doing.”\n","“No. It was Cersei who decided that the Iron Bank would wait for their due. Should I\n","send her to Braavos?”\n","Ser Harys blinked. “Her Grace … that … that …”\n","Ser Kevan rescued him. “That was a jape. A bad one. Go and find a warm fire. I mean\n","to do the same.” He yanked his gloves on and set off across the yard, leaning hard into the\n","wind as his cloak snapped and swirled behind him.\n","The dry moat surrounding Maegor’s Holdfast was three feet deep in snow, the iron\n","spikes that lined it glistening with frost. The only way in or out of Maegor’s was across\n","the drawbridge that spanned that moat. A knight of the Kingsguard was always posted at\n","its far end. Tonight the duty had fallen to Ser Meryn Trant. With Balon Swann hunting the\n","rogue knight Darkstar down in Dorne, Loras Tyrell gravely wounded on Dragonstone, and\n","Jaime vanished in the riverlands, only four of the White Swords remained in King’s\n","Landing, and Ser Kevan had thrown Osmund Kettleblack (and his brother Osfryd) into the\n","dungeon within hours of Cersei’s confessing that she had taken both men as lovers. That\n","left only Trant, the feeble Boros Blount, and Qyburn’s mute monster Robert Strong to\n","protect the young king and royal family.\n","I will need to find some new swords for the Kingsguard. Tommen should have seven\n","good knights about him. In the past the Kingsguard had served for life, but that had not\n","stopped Joffrey from dismissing Ser Barristan Selmy to make a place for his dog, Sandor\n","Clegane. Kevan could make use of that precedent. I could put Lancel in a white cloak, he\n","reflected. There is more honor in that than he will ever find in the Warrior’s Sons.\n","Kevan Lannister hung his snow-sodden cloak inside his solar, pulled off his boots, and\n","commanded his serving man to fetch some fresh wood for his fire. “A cup of mulled wine\n","would go down well,” he said as he settled by the hearth. “See to it.”\n","The fire soon thawed him, and the wine warmed his insides nicely. It also made him\n","sleepy, so he dare not drink another cup. His day was far from done. He had reports to\n","read, letters to write. And supper with Cersei and the king. His niece had been subdued\n","and submissive since her walk of atonement, thank the gods. The novices who attended\n","her reported that she spent a third of her waking hours with her son, another third in\n","prayer, and the rest in her tub. She was bathing four or five times a day, scrubbing herself\n","with horsehair brushes and strong lye soap, as if she meant to scrape her skin off.\n","She will never wash the stain away, no matter how hard she scrubs. Ser Kevan\n","remembered the girl she once had been, so full of life and mischief. And when she’d\n","flowered, ahhhh … had there ever been a maid so sweet to look upon? If Aerys had agreed\n","to marry her to Rhaegar, how many deaths might have been avoided? Cersei could have\n","given the prince the sons he wanted, lions with purple eyes and silver manes … and with\n","such a wife, Rhaegar might never have looked twice at Lyanna Stark. The northern girl\n","had a wild beauty, as he recalled, though however bright a torch might burn it could never\n","match the rising sun.\n","But it did no good to brood on lost battles and roads not taken. That was a vice of old\n","done men. Rhaegar had wed Elia of Dorne, Lyanna Stark had died, Robert Baratheon had\n","taken Cersei to bride, and here they were. And tonight his own road would take him to his\n","niece’s chambers and face-to-face with Cersei.\n","I have no reason to feel guilty, Ser Kevan told himself. Tywin would understand that,\n","surely. It was his daughter who brought shame down on our name, not I. What I did I did\n","for the good of House Lannister.\n","It was not as if his brother had never done the same. In their father’s final years, after\n","their mother’s passing, their sire had taken the comely daughter of a candlemaker as\n","mistress. It was not unknown for a widowed lord to keep a common girl as\n","bedwarmer … but Lord Tytos soon began seating the woman beside him in the hall,\n","showering her with gifts and honors, even asking her views on matters of state. Within a\n","year she was dismissing servants, ordering about his household knights, even speaking for\n","his lordship when he was indisposed. She grew so influential that it was said about\n","Lannisport that any man who wished for his petition to be heard should kneel before her\n","and speak loudly to her lap … for Tytos Lannister’s ear was between his lady’s legs. She\n","had even taken to wearing their mother’s jewels.\n","Until the day their lord father’s heart had burst in his chest as he was ascending a steep\n","flight of steps to her bed, that is. All the self-seekers who had named themselves her\n","friends and cultivated her favor had abandoned her quickly enough when Tywin had her\n","stripped naked and paraded through Lannisport to the docks, like a common whore.\n","Though no man laid a hand on her, that walk spelled the end of her power. Surely Tywin\n","would never have dreamed that same fate awaited his own golden daughter.\n","“It had to be,” Ser Kevan muttered over the last of his wine. His High Holiness had to\n","be appeased. Tommen needed the Faith behind him in the battles to come. And\n","Cersei … the golden child had grown into a vain, foolish, greedy woman. Left to rule, she\n","would have ruined Tommen as she had Joffrey.\n","Outside the wind was rising, clawing at the shutters of his chamber. Ser Kevan pushed\n","himself to his feet. Time to face the lioness in her den. We have pulled her claws. Jaime,\n","though … But no, he would not brood on that.\n","He donned an old, well-worn doublet, in case his niece had a mind to throw another cup\n","of wine in his face, but he left his sword belt hanging on the back of his chair. Only the\n","knights of the Kingsguard were permitted swords in Tommen’s presence.\n","Ser Boros Blount was in attendance on the boy king and his mother when Ser Kevan\n","entered the royal chambers. Blount wore enameled scale, white cloak, and halfhelm. He\n","did not look well. Of late Boros had grown notably heavier about the face and belly, and\n","his color was not good. And he was leaning against the wall behind him, as if standing had\n","become too great an effort for him.\n","The meal was served by three novices, well-scrubbed girls of good birth between the\n","ages of twelve and sixteen. In their soft white woolens, each seemed more innocent and\n","unworldly than the last, yet the High Septon had insisted that no girl spend more than\n","seven days in the queen’s service, lest Cersei corrupt her. They tended the queen’s\n","wardrobe, drew her bath, poured her wine, changed her bedclothes of a morning. One\n","shared the queen’s bed every night, to ascertain she had no other company; the other two\n","slept in an adjoining chamber with the septa who looked over them.\n","A tall stork of a girl with a pockmarked face escorted him into the royal presence.\n","Cersei rose when he entered and kissed him lightly on the cheek. “Dear uncle. It is so\n","good of you to sup with us.” The queen was dressed as modestly as any matron, in a dark\n","brown gown that buttoned up to her throat and a hooded green mantle that covered her\n","shaved head. Before her walk she would have flaunted her baldness beneath a golden\n","crown. “Come, sit,” she said. “Will you have wine?”\n","“A cup.” He sat, still wary.\n","A freckled novice filled their cups with hot spiced wine. “Tommen tells me that Lord\n","Tyrell intends to rebuild the Tower of the Hand,” Cersei said.\n","Ser Kevan nodded. “The new tower will be twice as tall as the one you burned, he\n","says.”\n","Cersei gave a throaty laugh. “Long lances, tall towers … is Lord Tyrell hinting at\n","something?”\n","That made him smile. It is good that she still remembers how to laugh. When he asked\n","if she had all that she required, the queen said, “I am well served. The girls are sweet, and\n","the good septas make certain that I say my prayers. But once my innocence is proved, it\n","would please me if Taena Merryweather might attend me once again. She could bring her\n","son to court. Tommen needs other boys about him, friends of noble birth.”\n","It was a modest request. Ser Kevan saw no reason why it should not be granted. He\n","could foster the Merryweather boy himself, whilst Lady Taena accompanied Cersei back\n","to Casterly Rock. “I will send for her after the trial,” he promised.\n","Supper began with beef-and-barley soup, followed by a brace of quail and a roast pike\n","near three feet long, with turnips, mushrooms, and plenty of hot bread and butter. Ser\n","Boros tasted every dish that was set before the king. A humiliating duty for a knight of the\n","Kingsguard, but perhaps all Blount was capable of these days … and wise, after the way\n","Tommen’s brother had died.\n","The king seemed happier than Kevan Lannister had seen him in a long time. From soup\n","to sweet Tommen burbled about the exploits of his kittens, whilst feeding them morsels of\n","pike off his own royal plate. “The bad cat was outside my window last night,” he informed\n","Kevan at one point, “but Ser Pounce hissed at him and he ran off across the roofs.”\n","“The bad cat?” Ser Kevan said, amused. He is a sweet boy.\n","“An old black tomcat with a torn ear,” Cersei told him. “A filthy thing, and foultempered. He clawed Joff’s hand once.” She made a face. “The cats keep the rats down, I\n","know, but that one … he’s been known to attack ravens in the rookery.”\n","“I will ask the ratters to set a trap for him.” Ser Kevan could not remember ever seeing\n","his niece so quiet, so subdued, so demure. All for the good, he supposed. But it made him\n","sad as well. Her fire is quenched, she who used to burn so bright. “You have not asked\n","about your brother,” he said, as they were waiting for the cream cakes. Cream cakes were\n","the king’s favorite.\n","Cersei lifted her chin, her green eyes shining in the candlelight. “Jaime? Have you had\n","word?”\n","“None. Cersei, you may need to prepare yourself for—”\n","“If he were dead, I would know it. We came into this world together, Uncle. He would\n","not go without me.” She took a drink of wine. “Tyrion can leave whenever he wishes. You\n","have had no word of him either, I suppose.”\n","“No one has tried to sell us a dwarf’s head of late, no.”\n","She nodded. “Uncle, may I ask you a question?”\n","“Whatever you wish.”\n","“Your wife … do you mean to bring her to court?”\n","“No.” Dorna was a gentle soul, never comfortable but at home with friends and kin\n","around her. She had done well by their children, dreamed of having grandchildren, prayed\n","seven times a day, loved needlework and flowers. In King’s Landing she would be as\n","happy as one of Tommen’s kittens in a pit of vipers. “My lady wife mislikes travel.\n","Lannisport is her place.”\n","“It is a wise woman who knows her place.”\n","He did not like the sound of that. “Say what you mean.”\n","“I thought I did.” Cersei held out her cup. The freckled girl filled it once again. The\n","cream cakes appeared then, and the conversation took a lighter turn. Only after Tommen\n","and his kittens were escorted off to the royal bedchamber by Ser Boros did their talk turn\n","to the queen’s trial.\n","“Osney’s brothers will not stand by idly and watch him die,” Cersei warned him.\n","“I did not expect that they would. I’ve had the both of them arrested.”\n","That seemed to take her aback. “For what crime?”\n","“Fornication with a queen. His High Holiness says that you confessed to bedding both\n","of them—had you forgotten?”\n","Her face reddened. “No. What will you do with them?”\n","“The Wall, if they admit their guilt. If they deny it, they can face Ser Robert. Such men\n","should never have been raised so high.”\n","Cersei lowered her head. “I … I misjudged them.”\n","“You misjudged a good many men, it seems.”\n","He might have said more, but the dark-haired novice with the round cheeks returned to\n","say, “My lord, my lady, I am sorry to intrude, but there is a boy below. Grand Maester\n","Pycelle begs the favor of the Lord Regent’s presence at once.”\n","Dark wings, dark words, Ser Kevan thought. Could Storm’s End have fallen? Or might\n","this be word from Bolton in the north?\n","“It might be news of Jaime,” the queen said.\n","There was only one way to know. Ser Kevan rose. “Pray excuse me.” Before he took his\n","leave, he dropped to one knee and kissed his niece upon the hand. If her silent giant failed\n","her, it might be the last kiss she would ever know.\n","The messenger was a boy of eight or nine, so bundled up in fur he seemed a bear cub.\n","Trant had kept him waiting out on the drawbridge rather than admit him into Maegor’s.\n","“Go find a fire, lad,” Ser Kevan told him, pressing a penny into his hand. “I know the way\n","to the rookery well enough.”\n","The snow had finally stopped falling. Behind a veil of ragged clouds, a full moon\n","floated fat and white as a snowball. The stars shone cold and distant. As Ser Kevan made\n","his way across the inner ward, the castle seemed an alien place, where every keep and\n","tower had grown icy teeth, and all familiar paths had vanished beneath a white blanket.\n","Once an icicle long as a spear fell to shatter by his feet. Autumn in King’s Landing, he\n","brooded. What must it be like up on the Wall?\n","The door was opened by a serving girl, a skinny thing in a fur-lined robe much too big\n","for her. Ser Kevan stamped the snow off his boots, removed his cloak, tossed it to her.\n","“The Grand Maester is expecting me,” he announced. The girl nodded, solemn and silent,\n","and pointed to the steps.\n","Pycelle’s chambers were beneath the rookery, a spacious suite of rooms cluttered with\n","racks of herbs and salves and potions and shelves jammed full of books and scrolls. Ser\n","Kevan had always found them uncomfortably hot. Not tonight. Once past the chamber\n","door, the chill was palpable. Black ash and dying embers were all that remained of the\n","hearthfire. A few flickering candles cast pools of dim light here and there.\n","The rest was shrouded in shadow … except beneath the open window, where a spray of\n","ice crystals glittered in the moonlight, swirling in the wind. On the window seat a raven\n","loitered, pale, huge, its feathers ruffled. It was the largest raven that Kevan Lannister had\n","ever seen. Larger than any hunting hawk at Casterly Rock, larger than the largest owl.\n","Blowing snow danced around it, and the moon painted it silver.\n","Not silver. White. The bird is white.\n","The white ravens of the Citadel did not carry messages, as their dark cousins did. When\n","they went forth from Oldtown, it was for one purpose only: to herald a change of seasons.\n","“Winter,” said Ser Kevan. The word made a white mist in the air. He turned away from\n","the window.\n","Then something slammed him in the chest between the ribs, hard as a giant’s fist. It\n","drove the breath from him and sent him lurching backwards. The white raven took to the\n","air, its pale wings slapping him about the head. Ser Kevan half-sat and half-fell onto the\n","window seat. What … who … A quarrel was sunk almost to the fletching in his chest. No.\n","No, that was how my brother died. Blood was seeping out around the shaft. “Pycelle,” he\n","muttered, confused. “Help me … I …”\n","Then he saw. Grand Maester Pycelle was seated at his table, his head pillowed on the\n","great leather-bound tome before him. Sleeping, Kevan thought … until he blinked and saw\n","the deep red gash in the old man’s spotted skull and the blood pooled beneath his head,\n","staining the pages of his book. All around his candle were bits of bone and brain, islands\n","in a lake of melted wax.\n","He wanted guards, Ser Kevan thought. I should have sent him guards. Could Cersei\n","have been right all along? Was this his nephew’s work? “Tyrion?” he called. “Where …?”\n","“Far away,” a half-familiar voice replied.\n","He stood in a pool of shadow by a bookcase, plump, pale-faced, round-shouldered,\n","clutching a crossbow in soft powdered hands. Silk slippers swaddled his feet.\n","“Varys?”\n","The eunuch set the crossbow down. “Ser Kevan. Forgive me if you can. I bear you no\n","ill will. This was not done from malice. It was for the realm. For the children.”\n","I have children. I have a wife. Oh, Dorna. Pain washed over him. He closed his eyes,\n","opened them again. “There are … there are hundreds of Lannister guardsmen in this\n","castle.”\n","“But none in this room, thankfully. This pains me, my lord.

So …”\n","A gust of wind blew up. Ser Kevan shivered violently.\n","“Are you cold, my lord?” asked Varys. “Do forgive me.

Someone somewhere will find a way to blame the\n","Dornishmen. Doubt, division, and mistrust will eat the very ground beneath your boy king,\n","whilst Aegon raises his banner above Storm’s End and the lords of the realm gather round\n","him.”\n","“Aegon?” For a moment he did not understand. Then he remembered. A babe swaddled\n","in a crimson cloak, the cloth stained with his blood and brains. “Dead. He’s dead.”\n","“No.” The eunuch’s voice seemed deeper. “He is here. Aegon has been shaped for rule\n","since before he could walk. He has been trained in arms, as befits a knight to be, but that\n","was not the end of his education. He reads and writes, he speaks several tongues, he has\n","studied history and law and poetry. A septa has instructed him in the mysteries of the Faith\n","since he was old enough to understand them. He has lived with fisherfolk, worked with his\n","hands, swum in rivers and mended nets and learned to wash his own clothes at need. He\n","can fish and cook and bind up a wound, he knows what it is like to be hungry, to be\n","hunted, to be afraid. Tommen has been taught that kingship is his right. Aegon knows that\n","kingship is his duty, that a king must put his people first, and live and rule for them.”\n","Kevan Lannister tried to cry out … to his guards, his wife, his brother … but the words\n","would not come. Blood dribbled from his mouth. He shuddered violently.\n","“I am sorry.” Varys wrung his hands. “You are suffering, I know, yet here I stand going\n","on like some silly old woman. Time to make an end to it.” The eunuch pursed his lips and\n","gave a little whistle.\n","Ser Kevan was cold as ice, and every labored breath sent a fresh stab of pain through\n","him. He glimpsed movement, heard the soft scuffling sound of slippered feet on stone. A\n","child emerged from a pool of darkness, a pale boy in a ragged robe, no more than nine or\n","ten. Another rose up behind the Grand Maester’s chair. The girl who had opened the door\n","for him was there as well.
